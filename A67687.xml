            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>The Preface.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>I</hi> Have often thought how very ſtrangely ſuch a Treatiſe as this will look in the Eyes of <hi>many</hi> in the World; and how it muſt be reſented and received by them. Even with great Diſguſt (if not with Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt) inſtead of regard or approbation. And no wonder it ſhould, conſidering how little Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruity there is, betwixt <hi>its Genius,</hi> and <hi>their Temper.</hi> For as it lies quite Croſs to their Common Principles, ſo it runs as contrary to the courſe of their Practice. The Generality of men, as all know, are only for <hi>gay</hi> and <hi>pleaſing</hi> things. For things that ſuit their Humour, and delight their Fancy, and ſerve to Entertain and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify Curioſity. And theſe ('twill be granted) muſt be <hi>light</hi> for ſome, and <hi>lofty</hi> for others, and of various Taſts, for differing Palates. But how ſhould this Piece be taking with <hi>ſuch,</hi> or eſcape being deſpiſed and decried by them? as being <hi>wholly pious,</hi> and moſt <hi>deeply practical,</hi> and written in ſo familiar, and ſo low a ſtrain? For intending it for the uſe of <hi>ordinary</hi> Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, in reaſon I was obliged to fit its Compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure exactly to their Capacity, that ſo it might be the more ſerviceable to them. And accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly in it there is Nothing that is <hi>high,</hi> No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that is <hi>fine</hi> either in matter or method; but only honeſt Truth in its plaineſt Dreſs, and a pious Duty earneſtly recommended to the <hi>ſerious</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:34484:6"/> and the <hi>good.</hi> And truly as for <hi>others</hi> I never deſigned to trouble them with it, nor indeed is it over-<hi>proper</hi> for them. For be they never ſo learned and ingenious, and not <hi>ſober</hi> and <hi>good;</hi> they can neither throughly <hi>underſtand,</hi> nor truly <hi>reliſh</hi> what it contains. Not that its Contents are ſo <hi>lofty,</hi> as to be above their reach; but ſo <hi>Religious,</hi> as to be out of their way. Again therefore I declare it to be uſeful to none, ſo much as to them that are ſeriouſly <hi>good.</hi> And to <hi>all</hi> ſuch I moſt heartily recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend it; with the great <hi>Duty</hi> that is urged in it, what Rank or Quality ſoever they are of. However we may be of divers <hi>Perſuaſions,</hi> yet I Earneſtly beg, that our different Judgments may not hinder our <hi>uniting</hi> here in ſo weighty a Performance. For if we be but ſincerely and throughly <hi>good</hi> (and ſo hearty lovers of all heavenly Truth; and ready to receive it, whereſoever we diſcern it, and deſirous to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover it, that ſo we may embrace it;) I hope that GOD (notwithſtanding the variety of our unhappy Miſtakes, involuntary Prejudices, and unaffected Errors) will hear our Sighs, and ſee our Tears, and anſwer our devout and mournful Prayers, with all needful Bleſſings. Yet I intend not that this <hi>general</hi> recommen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation ſhould reach to <hi>one ſort</hi> of men; to thoſe I mean in the Sacred Function. For as I know, they are well able in all things elſe to be my Inſtructors; ſo this very Work of holy Mourning, they can do in ways and meaſures of
<pb facs="tcp:34484:6"/> their own, far better than any that I can di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect.</p>
            <p>The chief <hi>Reaſon</hi> of my Publiſhing this Book, is the <hi>great need</hi> that there is of it. For as our Nature is prone to Sin, ſo Numbers amongſt us abound with it in their Practice. A thing ſo obvious even to common and incuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous obſervation; that to Attempt to prove it, would be pure Impertinence. But then the Judgments of God, and endleſs Deſtruction, being the natural fruits and products of our ſins (eſpecially where they are ſo rife and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious) to <hi>mourn</hi> for our ſins muſt be as <hi>need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful</hi> for us; as it is to avert our impending Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries, and to prevent our Eternal Ruine. And if to mourn for our ſins be abſolutely <hi>needful</hi> upon theſe Accounts; 'tis every whit as need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful that we be taught <hi>how</hi> to do it: And in this Diſcourſe is that Doctrine delivered.</p>
            <p>I muſt here add this material <hi>Caution: Let none in a ſtate, or courſe of ſin (of any known and deliberate ſin) apply themſelves to obſerving the Rules here laid down.</hi> For to mourn for our <hi>own</hi> or <hi>others</hi> Sins, while we fooliſhly perſiſt in what we lament; is but pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſterouſly to trifle with GOD, and under the Specious colour of moſt ſerious Duty, to affront and provoke him with ſaddeſt Hypocriſy. Let all that take this Treatiſe for their Guide, be really <hi>righteous,</hi> or firmly <hi>reſolve</hi> forthwith to be ſo. Then, I hope, it will be helpful to them. But leſt any ſhould think they ſhall reap
<pb facs="tcp:34484:7"/> the leaſt benefit, by the ſtricteſt obſervation of its Directions, while they indulge themſelves in any <hi>choſen</hi> ſin; again I plainly declare to ſuch, that they will rather <hi>offend</hi> and <hi>provoke</hi> God, than profit themſelves. The <hi>beſt</hi> that they can look for, is that they ſhall certainly <hi>loſe their labour;</hi> for all that they do will be in vain. To this agrees the Doctrine of that Great Man, the Son of <hi>Sirach. He that waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth himſelf after the touching of a dead bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, if he touch it again, what availeth his waſhing? So it is with a Man that faſteth for his Sins, and goeth again and doth the ſame: Who will hear his Prayer, or what doth his humbling profit him?</hi> Ecclus. <hi>34.25, 26.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>One <hi>Requeſt</hi> now concludes the Preface.</p>
            <p>That they who uſe this Book and find Benefit by it; would not only give <hi>Glory</hi> to GOD for it, to whom alone it <hi>wholly</hi> belongs: But alſo that they would Remember its unworthy Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſer in their daily <hi>Prayers;</hi> eſpecially on the days of their Devout and Solemn Addreſſes to Heaven.</p>

               <p>And if we look more downward into the Frame of our Being, we ſhall ſee that our <hi>Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions</hi> (tho' much inferior to the mentioned Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties) were contrived by the all-wiſe GOD, Who made them; for our very <hi>Souls</hi> Improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. For when He put them into us, it was that they might be inſtrumental to our heavenly and eternal, as well as to our temporal and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Intereſts. <hi>Love,</hi> for inſtance, He plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in us, to fix our Hearts immoveably on Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and to carry them out in Deſires towards Him, with all the Force, and Vigour, and Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemence, which that Sweet and Powerful Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple has. <hi>Fear,</hi> to awe our Minds into Seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, and ſo to balaſt them as to keep them ſteady: that <hi>they</hi> being toſſed with no Lightneſs or Folly, <hi>we</hi> may be kept from all Looſneſs and Sin. <hi>Hope,</hi> to draw us to true Religion, and not only to induce us <hi>to</hi> it, but to encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage us <hi>in</hi> it; while lively Expectation of its future Rewards, carries us through all its pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Difficulties; enabling us with Laudable Patience and Zeal, to perform both its active and paſſive Duties. <hi>Joy,</hi> to enliven and elevate our Spirits; that ſo beſides zealous Patience and Conſtancy, we may perſiſt in our Duties with Alacrity and Pleaſure. For where <hi>Joy</hi> inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mingles with the Offices of Religion, it abates or takes off the uneaſineſs of them, and turns them into real and high Delight. To mention no more, even <hi>Grief</hi> it ſelf (as mean a Paſſion
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:34484:8"/> as men think it, and as bitter and irkſome as it ſeems to be) is of ſingular uſe to the Sincere Chriſtian, and ſerves him in his beſt and nobleſt concerns with an happy Efficacy. Tho' to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance in what <hi>Particulars</hi> it does it, would be to anticipate the Matter of this Treatiſe; in the Sequel of which they will Sufficiently appear. At preſent therefore we note but this much: That <hi>Grief</hi> is eminently ſerviceable to good Chriſtians, as it miniſters to holy or religious <hi>Mourning;</hi> and is an eſſential or conſtituent <hi>Part</hi> of the ſame. This will be evident if we do but conſider <hi>what</hi> religious Mourning is. And that, I think, may not improperly be thus deſcribed. It is <hi>a bleſſed Work of the</hi> HOLY GHOST, <hi>whereby we grieve heartily upon ſome ſpiritual account.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is a work of the HOLY GHOST. Nor can it be otherwiſe. For where a plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Effuſion of HIM is promiſed; we find holy <hi>Mourning,</hi> in the true Church, to be an immediate <hi>Fruit</hi> of it. <hi>I will pour upon the houſe of</hi> David, <hi>and upon the Inhabitants of</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>the</hi> SPIRIT, ſays GOD, <hi>Zech.</hi> 12.10. And then it follows in the next Verſe, <hi>in that Day there ſhall be a great Mourning.</hi> To Mourn as <hi>Men,</hi> is incident to all, and indeed inevitable. As Nature hath given us <hi>Power</hi> to do it, So our Circumſtances give us <hi>Occaſion</hi> enough, here in this State of Mortality and Miſery. But to Mourn as <hi>Chriſtians</hi> is quite another thing. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious Sorrow grows at no time upon the Stock of mere Nature, tho' never ſo well cultivated by Virtuous Education. <hi>That</hi> no where flows with any laudable Stream, but where the HOLY GHOST firſt opens the Springs. <hi>He bloweth
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:34484:9"/> with His Wind, and the Waters flow,</hi> Pſal. 147.18. St. <hi>Jerom</hi> from a <hi>literal,</hi> turns the Text to an <hi>Allegorical</hi> Senſe; and by the <hi>Wind</hi> underſtands the <hi>Spirit</hi> of GOD. But then the Waters which by <hi>His</hi> means flow, are no other than thoſe of <hi>pious Tears,</hi> which cannot flow unleſs <hi>He</hi> cauſes them to do it.</p>
               <p>And therefore, by the Way, we have no Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to think, that divine <hi>Comforts</hi> are either the Sole or the Chief <hi>Indication</hi> of the Good SPI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RIT's kind and propitious <hi>preſence.</hi> Godly <hi>Sorrow</hi> is as clear a Symptom, and asſure a Proof of the HOLY GHOST's <hi>reſting</hi> upon us, or <hi>reſiding</hi> in us; as the moſt refreſhing <hi>Joys</hi> can be. And therefore as humble <hi>Acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> ſhould be made to GOD, and as hearty <hi>Praiſes</hi> rendred to Him for the one, as for the other. The <hi>Cloudy Pillar</hi> was as evident a Token of GOD's Providential Care of the <hi>Jews,</hi> and of His ſpecial Reſidence with them; as the <hi>Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar of Fire:</hi> tho' all know it was not ſo bright a one. And tho' the SPIRIT's Conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are a more lightſome Sign of His Deſcent upon us; yet holy Mourning muſt be as plain a Mark of his gracious Preſence, as being as much an Effect of His favourable Influence. And then</p>
               <p>It is <hi>a bleſſed</hi> Work of His. Bleſſed in the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire Capacity of it. For as it is wrought in us by a bleſſed <hi>Cauſe,</hi> the breathing of this Glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous SPIRIT we ſpeak of; and as it is of a bleſſed <hi>Nature,</hi> being a lamenting of our Wandrings <hi>from,</hi> and Actings <hi>againſt</hi> the Laws and Intereſts of Righteouſneſs: So it hath a moſt bleſſed <hi>Tendency.</hi> For it tends directly to the purging our of Sin, to the purifying of the
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:34484:9"/> Soul, to the making us upright and holy upon Earth, and happy in the Kingdom of Heaven for ever.</p>
               <p>We farther deſcribe it to be a <hi>Grieving heartily.</hi> As there can be <hi>no</hi> Mourning, where there is <hi>no</hi> Grieving; ſo, on the other ſide, where the Mourning is <hi>holy,</hi> the Grief will be <hi>hearty.</hi> There are <hi>two Reaſons</hi> for it: The <hi>Nature</hi> of thoſe <hi>things</hi> which <hi>occaſion</hi> it; and the <hi>Power</hi> of that <hi>Being</hi> which <hi>excites</hi> to it.</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>The Nature of thoſe things which occaſion it.</hi> Things of higheſt concern muſt be moſt affecting. But <hi>Spiritual</hi> things concern us moſt highly, and conſequently they muſt affect us moſt deeply. And of that ſort only are <hi>thoſe things</hi> which occaſion holy Mourning: they are either Spiritual in <hi>themſelves,</hi> or elſe have <hi>Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> to ſuch as are ſo.</p>
               <p>Not but that <hi>Temporal</hi> Accidents may be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly afflictive to good people, and make ſtrong Impreſſions of Grief upon them. Yea, ſome of them may aſſault them ſo rudely, and ſhock them ſo terribly, as to diſturb them more, and make wider Breaches in their Peace and Patience, than <hi>moſt</hi> ſpiritual conſiderations uſually do. But then Spiritual Evils, which are really deplorable, ſink <hi>deeper</hi> into them, and ſit <hi>cloſer</hi> upon them, and call for Mourning, and cauſe it too: when thoſe boiſterous Storms of bigger ſorrow which <hi>Temporal</hi> calamities raiſed in them, are quite over, and ſo perfectly gone, as to return no more. For tho' Worldly Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes do ſometimes ruffle us with mighty Violence; yet the great diſcompoſures which they give us, for the moſt part do in time ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, and are ſeldom laſting. Whereas <hi>Spiritual</hi>
                  <pb n="6" facs="tcp:34484:10"/> Sorrows, which are leſs raging, are more dura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: and by their long continuance ſhew that they are deeply rooted in the <hi>Heart,</hi> and have taken a more full Poſſeſſion of it. Thus we oft ſee the Paſſions even of well-grown Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, ſtrangely tumultuating; and at the Deaths of ſome of their Friends or Relations, tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting them beyond the Bounds of Decency and Moderation. Yet the ſame good people in a few Months, or Years after their Depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, are freed from theſe furious Tranſports of Grief; and can think and talk of the dear de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſed Ones, without a Sigh, or a Tear. But then theſe very Perſons can frequently be paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionate for GOD and their Souls; and to their dying Days, at times, can weep liberally for their Follies and their Sins. And this plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly argues, that pious Sorrow hath a deeper Place in the Heart, and faſter hold of it, than the other: and that dwelling conſtantly there, whenever it flows, it muſt proceed from thence. So that in ſhort, <hi>Civil</hi> Mourning, and <hi>Sacred,</hi> differ as much in <hi>themſelves,</hi> as a <hi>Shower,</hi> and a <hi>Spring;</hi> or as a ſudden <hi>Land-flood</hi> and a ſetled <hi>River.</hi> And in reference to the <hi>Heart,</hi> they differ as much, as a <hi>Stranger</hi> in an Houſe, does from the <hi>Owner</hi> or <hi>Inhabitant.</hi> For the One, as a troubleſome and unwelcome Gueſt, does now and then come and lodge in it: the Other, as the Proprietor, or Occupant of it, reſides con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually there, and is always ready to iſſue thence, as Occaſions ſhall happen to call it forth. And theſe Occaſional Provocations be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of great Force, by being, as hath been ſaid, of a <hi>Spiritual Nature;</hi> religious Mourning muſt needs be <hi>hearty:</hi> eſpecially when in the pious
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:34484:10"/> Heart it is ſo throughly, and ſo deeply grounded.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Religious Mourning muſt be <hi>hearty,</hi> becauſe a <hi>powerful Being</hi> excites unto it. And what that mighty Being is, our Deſcription of Holy Mourning ſhews, as it makes it a Work of the HOLY GHOST. <hi>Outward</hi> Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects act upon the <hi>Senſes</hi> (they have no other way to come at the Soul;) yet how violently they ſtrike, and how vehemently they affect, every one of us feel. But when one <hi>Spirit</hi> acts upon another, the Action, in reaſon, muſt be<note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Note</hi> I.</note> 
                  <hi>ſtronger.</hi> And ſo how can religious Mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing be otherwiſe than <hi>hearty,</hi> when the good Soul is at once both ſtirred up <hi>to</hi> it, and actua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <hi>in</hi> it by the SPIRIT of GOD? Who by his gracious Operations diſpoſes her <hi>to,</hi> and aſſiſts her <hi>in</hi> that pious Exerciſe.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, We deſcribe holy Mourning, to be a grieving <hi>upon ſome Spiritual account.</hi> For as it takes its Riſe from Spiritual Principles, and as it tends directly to Spiritual Ends; ſo its Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs all-a-long is upon Spiritual <hi>Grounds</hi> or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations. Tho' it be expreſt in natural Paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and there moſt evidently, where it runs ſo high as to reach to <hi>Tears;</hi> yet that Paſſion is raiſed and ſet on work with Reſpect <hi>to,</hi> and by the Force <hi>of</hi> things that are <hi>Supernatural</hi> and <hi>Divine.</hi> It fares with us in <hi>Mourning,</hi> much as it does in <hi>Singing.</hi> The ſame Organs ſerve as well for a Common Sonnet, as for a Church Anthem; yet in the Caſes there is conſiderable Difference. For in the <hi>one,</hi> there is Muſic only in the <hi>Voice;</hi> and to the <hi>Ears</hi> of <hi>Men:</hi> Whereas in the other, there is Melody<note n="†" place="margin">Eph. 5.19.</note> in the <hi>Heart</hi> made unto the LORD. So the
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:34484:11"/> ſame Paſſion is Uſed in holy Mourning, that is Employed in ordinary Grieving. But yet there is great Difference betwixt them: for the one Commences upon low Accounts, relating to this preſent earthly State; the other proceeds upon more refined and elevated Conſiderations, belonging to the ſpiritual and coeleſtial Life.</p>
               <p>As for the <hi>Sorts</hi> of religious Mourning, they are <hi>Two:</hi> Public, and Private.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Public</hi> is when a City, People, Church, or Nation are ingaged in it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Private,</hi> is of <hi>Two Kinds.</hi> For it relates to <hi>others,</hi> or elſe to <hi>our ſelves.</hi> As it relates to <hi>others,</hi> it hath reſpect to their <hi>Miſeries,</hi> or to their <hi>Impieties.</hi> If it reſpects their <hi>Miſeries,</hi> it is matter of <hi>Sympathy.</hi> If it reſpects their <hi>Impieties,</hi> it is matter of <hi>Charity.</hi> As it relates to <hi>our ſelves,</hi> it hath reſpect either to our <hi>Sufferings,</hi> or to our <hi>Duties,</hi> or to our <hi>Sins.</hi> If it reſpects our <hi>Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,</hi> it is <hi>pious affliction;</hi> If it reſpects our <hi>Duties,</hi> it is a piece of <hi>Zeal;</hi> If it reſpects our <hi>Sins,</hi> it is a part of <hi>Repentance.</hi> We ſhall ſpeak to it briefly in <hi>both</hi> its <hi>Sorts,</hi> and in the reſpective <hi>Branches</hi> ſpringing from <hi>each</hi> of them. Tho' our Deſign is chiefly to promote <hi>Mourning</hi> for <hi>Sin,</hi> and mourning for it in <hi>Private.</hi>

                  <p>Public <hi>Mourning</hi> when <hi>to be uſed. By</hi> whom <hi>to be appointed. The</hi> Practice <hi>of it</hi> anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent. <hi>Its great</hi> Succeſs <hi>noted in the</hi> Nine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites, <hi>which</hi> encourages us <hi>to it, when injoyned.</hi>
                  </p>
               </argument>
               <p>
                  <hi>PUblick</hi> Mourning is properly to be underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken upon <hi>Public</hi> Accounts. That is, when the Sins of a <hi>People</hi> are grown loud and high; and Judgments or Calamities, by reaſon of them, are <hi>heavy upon</hi> them, or <hi>like</hi> to be ſo. <hi>Then</hi> is the ſeaſon of <hi>Public</hi> Mourning, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of ſingular Uſe to remove thoſe Judgments, or avert them; by procuring Pardon for ſuch provoking Sins, as were the Cauſe, or might be the ſad Occaſion of them.</p>
               <p>As for the Ordering or Appointing this ſort of Mourning, it belongs to the <hi>Magiſtrates.</hi> Their Office and Care it is, to call the People that are under them to it, and to put them upon it, where they find it needful to be done. For Supreme Magiſtrates being<note n="*" place="margin">Ultriuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que tabu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lae cuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des.</note> Keepers of both the Tables of the Law; they are firmly obliged to take care of <hi>Religion,</hi> as well as of Political, or State-affairs. And ſo whenever they apprehend Religious Faſting and Mourning to be neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, they are bound to Command their Subjects to the ſame, that are under their Government, and can conveniently join in them. And to make good this, there are ſeveral <hi>Examples</hi> in holy Scripture, of Princes, in joining their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective Subjects to perform theſe Duties. Some
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:34484:12"/> of theſe Examples we ſhall by and by touch upon.</p>
               <p>If we look to the <hi>Riſe</hi> of Public Mourning, we ſhall find it Early in the Church. In <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muel</hi>'s days the <hi>Jews</hi> were no Strangers to it. For in the firſt of thoſe Books which bear that Prophet's Name, it is remembred;<note n="*" place="margin">Chap. 7.5, 6.</note> that <hi>all Iſrael were gathered together to</hi> Mizpeh, <hi>and drew Water, and poured it out before the</hi> LORD, <hi>and faſted in that day, and ſaid there, We have ſinned againſt the</hi> LORD. There are that imagine this Water was Water of <hi>Trial,</hi> like that of <hi>Jealouſy.</hi> And accordingly they tell us, that as many as drank of it, if they were Idolaters, their Lips by Virtue of it would cleave together; and that ſo faſt, as not to be parted. But the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter here was not to be <hi>drank,</hi> but was <hi>poured out:</hi> and therefore this ſeems to be a meer Fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy; and indeed it is no other than a <hi>Rabbinical</hi> Fiction. Others by this Water underſtand more rightly, <hi>Poenitential Tears.</hi> And ſo the <hi>Chaldee</hi> Paraphraſe makes it to be. For <hi>that</hi> ſays, that <hi>repenting of their ſins, they drew water out of the Well of their heart, and wept abundantly before the</hi> LORD. And <hi>Grotius</hi> is of this opinion,<note n="*" place="margin">Aqua effuſa la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chrimas ſignificat. <hi>In loc.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>that the Water poured out ſignifies Tears.</hi> And of the ſame Judgment is <hi>Junius;</hi> That it is an<note n="†" place="margin">Hyper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolica de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gentis lamentationis, quaſi dicat, eos lachrimarum rivos ex intimo ſonte cordis hauſtos, oculis coram Domino profudiſſe. <hi>In loc.</hi>

                  <hi>Hyperbolical Deſcription of a great Lamenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; as if he ſhould ſay, that from their Eyes they poured out thoſe Rivers of Tears, which they drew from the inward fountain of their Heart.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:34484:12"/>
               <p>But Public religious Mourning claims a greater <hi>Antiquity</hi> than this. For four hundred Years before, even in <hi>Moſes</hi>'s time, we may obſerve it was practiſed by the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> in the Wilderneſs. So we find <hi>Moſes</hi> Himſelf, and the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> weeping for the ſins of ſome of the People, <hi>Numb.</hi> 25.6. And before <hi>that,</hi> they having brought themſelves into great Danger, into Danger of loſing GOD's pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitious Preſence, and of being ſuddenly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed for their ſins; in way of Prevention they betook themſelves forthwith to Holy Mourning, <hi>Exod.</hi> 33.4. And the Courſe they took prov'd very effectual. For by it they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered the ALMIGHTY's Favour, and a renewed Promiſe of the Continuation of His Gracious Preſence, which they had forfeited. And the happy Succeſs which crowned their Performance, might poſſibly raiſe its Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſo high with the Rulers of GOD's Church, as that they might <hi>ever after</hi> look upon it as a <hi>Pattern</hi> worthy of <hi>Imitation;</hi> and in the like Circumſtances, might be careful to ingage both themſelves and their People, in the Like Exerciſe.</p>
               <p>And truly whenever they did ſo, and were ſincerely devout in the Undertaking; a <hi>deſired Iſſue</hi> hath ſtill attended it. The ſacred Writings ſignify as much: out of them I alledge but <hi>two</hi> Inſtances of it.</p>
               <p>The <hi>firſt</hi> is that of the <hi>Jews</hi> in King <hi>Jehoſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phat</hi>'s time. When they were in fear of pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful and confederate Enemies<note n="*" place="margin">2 Chron. 20.3.</note>, he proclaimed a Faſt throughout all <hi>Judah.</hi> And His Subjects, in obedience to his Royal Proclamation, ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered themſelves together to ſeek the LORD.
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:34484:13"/> And being piouſly aſſembled, they ſtood before Him, with their Little Ones, their Wives and Children, asking Help of Him. And as with Faſting they prayed for Aid and Deliverance; ſo we need not doubt but they Joined holy <hi>Mourning</hi> with their Abſtinence, and Supplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, conſidering their Sins, and their immi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Dangers. And very ſignal was their <hi>ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs.</hi> For when they prayed thus Mournfully to Him, He heard them, and helped them. He cauſed their potent combined Enemies to fall out amongſt themſelves, and deſtroy one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and left juſt Nothing for them to do, but to ſeize the rich Spoil: and to gather that up, and to carry it away, coſt them <hi>three days</hi> time, it was ſo plentiful. This firſt Inſtance is of a People, that were <hi>actually</hi> in Covenant with Heaven, and profeſſed Worſhippers of the True GOD. But even <hi>Heathens</hi> themſelves have found good ſucceſs in Public Mourning.</p>
               <p>The <hi>ſecond</hi> Inſtance therefore ſhall be of <hi>them;</hi> I mean the <hi>Ninevites. Nineveh</hi> was a great and populous City. So great, that it was almoſt fifty Miles in Compaſs, had Walls of an extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary Breadth, an hundred and twenty Foot high, and beſet with fifteen hundred Towers. So populous, that when <hi>Jonah</hi> propheſied againſt it<note n="*" place="margin">Jon. 4.11.</note>, there were ſixſcore thouſand in it ſo Young, that they knew not their Right hand from their Left. Now to this mighty City GOD ſent a moſt diſmal Meſſage:<note n="†" place="margin">Jon. 3.4.</note> 
                  <hi>Yet forty Days and</hi> Nineveh <hi>ſhall be overthrown.</hi> Tho' He did not declare <hi>how,</hi> or by what Means it ſhould be done. The divine Herald entring into the Town, for three days together aloud proclaim'd its appointed Deſtiny, by repeated Denuncia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:34484:13"/> of that dreadful Sentence.<note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Note</hi> II.</note> This ſo ſtruck the King of <hi>Nineveh,</hi> that he preſently iſſu'd out his Proclamation, requiring all the Inhabitants of it to keep a ſtrict Faſt, to be co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered with Sack-cloth, and to Cry mightily unto GOD. Which <hi>mighty Crying</hi> implies public religious <hi>Mourning.</hi> And what this Prince in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joined His <hi>People</hi> to do, he ſeriouſly acted in His own <hi>Perſon.</hi> And that theſe their humble <hi>mournful</hi> Applications were highly <hi>ſucceſsful,</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears from the Event. For ſo pleaſing was their pious carriage to GOD, that as ſoon as He beheld it, His Anger was pacified, His Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence reverſed, and conſequently their impend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Ruine averted. For when God <hi>ſaw their Works, that they turned from their Evil way,</hi> GOD <hi>repented of the Evil that He ſaid, He would do unto them, and He did it not,</hi> Jon. 3.10. Whence <hi>we</hi> may lawfully inferr and conclude, that if <hi>we</hi> do, upon occaſion, as theſe <hi>Nine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites</hi> did, we may ſpeed no worſe than they, as having reaſon to hope that we ſhall rather Speed better. For GOD, who was ſo Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful to a Mourning <hi>Heathen City,</hi> may well be more Gracious to a Mourning <hi>Chriſtian Church.</hi> And truly conſidering how <hi>provoking</hi> our Sins are, and what <hi>fearful Dangers</hi> they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe us to; it is much to be wiſht, that <hi>one</hi> or <hi>two Days</hi> might <hi>Yearly</hi> be ſet apart (ſuch as to our <hi>Sovereign</hi>'s Wiſdom ſhall ſeem fitteſt) for <hi>public Faſting</hi> and <hi>Mourning</hi> for the <hi>Nation</hi>'s Sins. And as often as ſuch ſolemn Days are appointed, it ſhould be every ones care that they be as ſolemnly kept or obſerved. For if we fail in that Duty, which, as we ſee, very <hi>Heathens</hi> performed; we may well expect to

               <argument>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Of</hi> Private <hi>Mourning as it relates to</hi> Others, <hi>and to</hi> Our ſelves.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>THO' <hi>Public</hi> Mourning is beſides our Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, yet let not that <hi>little</hi> which we have ſaid concerning it be thought impertinent: the Deſign of it being but to excite us <hi>to</hi> it, and ingage us <hi>in</hi> it, when at any time it ſhall be impoſed or required. We are now to ſpeak to <hi>private</hi> Religious Mourning. And this is mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of our free choice. We enter upon it vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarily, or of our own accord, without any intervention of the Civil Power, or Compul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion from it. As it relates to <hi>Others,</hi> it hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to <hi>two Evils,</hi> their <hi>Miſeries</hi> and their <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pieties.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt, unto their <hi>Miſeries.</hi> And as it dwells upon <hi>them,</hi> it ſprings up from a <hi>ſympathetic</hi> Principle. I mean, from thoſe Bowels of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion, Mercy, or Commiſeration, which the holy and elect of God are to put on, <hi>Col.</hi> 3.12. Thoſe choice Perſons that are happy in a true Sanctification, are full of Pity; of Pity ſo ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and affectionate, as commonly makes them prone to Tears. Being high in the Evangelical Spirit or Temper, they come up to the Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical Rule or Precept, <hi>Weep with them that weep, Rom.</hi> 12.15. And if we weep and mourn for our Brethrens <hi>outward Afflictions,</hi> it is no more than what our Religion obliges us to. For where the Chriſtian Law injoins us to <hi>be all of one mind,</hi> and to be <hi>loving to the Brethren,</hi>
                  <pb n="16" facs="tcp:34484:15"/> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.8. it means we ſhould <hi>be,</hi> and it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to <hi>make</hi> us of ſo ſweet a Temper, and of Spirits ſo united, and mutually endeared, as not to fail in <hi>ſympathizing</hi> with our Suffering Brethren; tho' their Troubles be but ſecular and external, ſo they be really ſharp or heavy.</p>
               <p>This may ſeem a melancholy Doctrine, yet to practiſe it is much our Duty, and therefore let us do it. Whenever we hear, or where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever we ſee any good People under GOD's hand, let us duly lay their Condition to heart. If they labour and groan under War, or Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, or Peſtilence, or Perſecution, or the like Judicial, or Providential Severities; let us be affected with their deplorable Calamities, and think of their Infelicities with Sorrowful Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentments. To this the Apoſtle inſtructs us powerfully, where He elegantly compares the whole Community of Chriſtians to a <hi>body Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganical;</hi> telling us, that tho' they be <hi>Many Members,</hi> yet <hi>they are but One Body,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.20. And then from the Compariſon He rightly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferrs the <hi>Sympathy</hi> we ſpeak of; that if one member <hi>ſuffers,</hi> all the members <hi>ſuffer</hi> with it, <hi>v.</hi> 26. So that not to be toucht with a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſionate fellow-feeling of good Chriſtians Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings, makes it queſtionable whether we be true living Members of CHRIST's Myſtical Body; or rather it puts it paſt all Queſtion, by making it evident that we are not ſuch. And tho' hearty Sympathizing with the Righteous in their Sufferings, was never ſo clearly taught, and forcibly recommended, as <hi>now</hi> under the Goſpel; yet on the Religious it was incumbent <hi>before,</hi> long before that bleſſed Diſpenſation came into the World. As much may be ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:34484:15"/> from that Paſſage, <hi>Amos</hi> 6.5, 6. For there the Prophet charged it as a Fault upon ſome in his Time, that they were unconcerned for good Mens Adverſity, and addicted them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to Pleaſures, while <hi>they</hi> Languiſht in Trouble. <hi>They chaunted to the Sound of the Viol, and invented to themſelves Inſtruments of Muſic like</hi> David; <hi>they drank Wine in Bowls, and anointed themſelves with chief Ointments; but they were not grieved for the Affliction of</hi> Joſeph. For us to live in high Delights, and to give up our ſelves to be Merry and Gay, when the Church of GOD is grievouſly afflicted, and in great Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulation; muſt needs be a Crime, and none of the Leaſt, by its falling thus under a <hi>Prophet</hi>'s Reproof. Very different from this, was the King of <hi>Iſrael</hi>'s Carriage, even to <hi>Evil</hi> Men, and ſuch as derided Him, and were injurious to Him. <hi>When they were ſick,</hi> ſays He, <hi>my Cloth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing was Sack-cloth, I humbled my Soul with Faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.— I behaved my ſelf as a Friend, or Brother; I bowed down heavily as one that Mourneth for His Mother, Pſal.</hi> 35.13, 14. How divinely Soft and Sympathetic was the Temper of this good Prince! When unworthy Wretches, baſe in themſelves, and ſpiteful to <hi>Him,</hi> fell into Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery; he Faſted and <hi>Mourned,</hi> and wore Sack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloth for them. Tho' they ſcorned, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligned, and aſperſed <hi>Him;</hi> yet he prayed moſt heartily and importunately for <hi>them:</hi> for GOD's Mercy to them, for His Bleſſing upon them, for His Deliverance of them. O that we did but demean our ſelves towards our beſt <hi>Friends</hi> when miſerable, and to the choiceſt and moſt eminent Servants of God, as this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowned Monarch did towards his Enemies,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:34484:16"/> and hypocritical <hi>mockers,</hi> as they are there ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med. Yet <hi>we</hi> are happy in a nobler Diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion than <hi>he</hi> was; and live in that time, when, according to the inſpired mans Prediction, <hi>he that is</hi> feeble <hi>ſhall be as</hi> David, <hi>Zech.</hi> 12.8.</p>
               <p>And as we muſt mourn in <hi>private</hi> for others <hi>Miſeries;</hi> ſo we muſt, 2ly, for their <hi>Impieties.</hi> And indeed <hi>much more</hi> for <hi>them,</hi> there being much more <hi>reaſon</hi> for it. Tho what the Reaſons for it are, we need not here conſider. We'll rather note at preſent, that <hi>Charity</hi> is the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple from which it flows, and that in this ſort of mourning, we exerciſe that Principle. And can we ſet it a Work upon a better Account? I believe that excellent man thought he could not, whoſe Wiſh it was, <hi>Oh that my Head were Waters, and mine Eyes a Fountain of Tears, that I might weep Day and Night, for the ſlain of the Daughter of my People, Jer.</hi> 9.1. But ſurely he meant (as in other places it appears) to weep more for thoſe that were ſlain morally by <hi>Sin,</hi> than for thoſe that were to be ſlaughter'd by the <hi>Sword.</hi> Charity, from which pious ſorrow ſprings, would cauſe him to ſhed moſt Tears for <hi>ſuch.</hi> And ſo it behoves us all to do. To mourn more for our <hi>ſinning,</hi> than for our <hi>ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering</hi> Brethren. And tho' we be ſhort of the Prophet in Goodneſs, yet in Proportion to our Virtues, and the Degrees of our Charity, let us bewail the miſcarriages of that People to whom we belong.</p>
               <p>But then beſides mourning for <hi>Others,</hi> we muſt mourn in private for <hi>our ſelves.</hi> And when we do ſo, our mourning hath reſpect to <hi>three</hi> things; to our <hi>Sufferings,</hi> to our <hi>Duties,</hi> or to our <hi>Sins.</hi> When it reſpects our <hi>Sufferings,</hi> it is
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:34484:16"/> pious <hi>Affliction.</hi> No ſooner do good Men feel themſelves in Pain, or fall into trouble, but they are ready to conſider from whence it comes. And if upon mature conſideration they find it deſcends from Heaven upon them, as the fruit of an offended GOD's diſpleaſure, and a juſt infliction of His deſerv'd ſeverity; it uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally brings an holy <hi>Grief</hi> upon them. Thus did <hi>David</hi> faſt, and weep, and lie all night upon the Earth, for the dangerous Sickneſs, and the threatned Death of His illegitimate Son, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12. Or if in the Sufferings they feel, there be no ſting of <hi>Guilt;</hi> but all the ſmart of them is rather from <hi>unhappineſs,</hi> than from <hi>ſinful unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thineſs;</hi> and more for trial perhaps than for pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment; yet then they are apt to relent too, and to be deeply penſive, and duly mournful in proportion to the uneaſineſs incident to them. So the Chriſtians at <hi>Miletus,</hi> wept ſorely, and ſorrowed extreamly, to underſtand they ſhould ſee <hi>Paul</hi>'s face no more, <hi>Act.</hi> 20.37, 38. And when our own demerits, or God's good Providence, ſhall at any time ſink us into In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>felicities; the like afflictive Sorrow will not only become us, but likewiſe benefit us: and I may ſafely averr, it is ſo far our <hi>Duty,</hi> as it makes for our beſt and our higheſt Intereſts.</p>
               <p>When private mourning reſpects our <hi>Duties,</hi> it hath the nature of <hi>Zeal</hi> in it. Thus he that is ſenſible he wants the Graces of Heaven, and <hi>prays</hi> earneſtly for them; and through heat, and vigour, and vehemence of his Spirit, <hi>mourns</hi> in his Supplications for the obtaining of them; his mourning is but <hi>Zeal,</hi> which plainly diſcovers it ſelf in his high Concern for his unhappy De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects, and his hearty Endeavour to get them ſupplied.</p>
               <pb n="20" facs="tcp:34484:17"/>
               <p>So he that <hi>acts</hi> the Heavenly Graces, which he hath, in <hi>fearing, believing,</hi> and <hi>loving</hi> of GOD, and <hi>weeps</hi> and <hi>mourns</hi> that he can do it no better; his mourning is <hi>Zeal,</hi> and this his Carriage is a fair Symptome or Indication of as much. For it ſhews that he is warm in theſe Actings already; and that he hath intenſe and ardent Deſires of more <hi>Awe</hi> of, of more <hi>Faith</hi> in, and of more <hi>Affection</hi> to the DEITY. In ſhort, when he that diſchargeth any Chriſtian Offices, grieves and <hi>mourns</hi> for his <hi>Deficiency</hi> in them: whence can this come but from Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure at himſelf for preſenting Services ſo imperfect; and from Eagerneſs to offer ſuch as are more worthy; and ſo what is it but un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feigned and inflamed <hi>Zeal,</hi> and a laudable Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, or Expreſſion of it?</p>
               <p>When private Mourning reſpects our <hi>own Sins,</hi> it may be lookt upon as a piece of true <hi>Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.</hi> Nor will it improperly come under that notion, as being the firſt great ſtep we uſually take in that needful Duty. For as they who feel nothing but <hi>Pleaſure</hi> in ſin, will be too fond of it, and delight ſo much in it as to be loth to leave it: So they who find it <hi>bitter</hi> and <hi>irk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome,</hi> will quickly diſguſt it, and by degrees grow weary of it, and be weaned from it, till they come finally to forſake it. Nor does mourning for ſin, as it renders it diſtaſtful, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come inſtrumental to our firſt <hi>Turn</hi> from it on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; but where it continues it conduces greatly to the <hi>conſummation</hi> of our Repentance alſo, helping to perfect, as well as to begin it. But of this more in the Sequel of the Treatiſe.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>What <hi>ſolemn</hi> Mourning in private is. Its principal <hi>Concomitants</hi> theſe Seven, <hi>Tears, Prayer, Faſting, Alms-deeds, Set-times, free Forgiveneſs,</hi> and <hi>ſelect Aſſociates.</hi>
                  </p>
               </argument>
               <p>BEfore we go any farther, we muſt remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, that it is not only <hi>Mourning,</hi> and <hi>pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate</hi> Religious Mourning that we here treat of; but ſuch private and religious Mourning as is <hi>ſolemn.</hi> Such holy Mourning, that is, as we do not fall into by <hi>Chance</hi> or preter-intentionally; and as we do not continue in contingently, and uncertainly, for ſome few Minutes according as it may happen: But ſuch as we deſign and propoſe to our ſelves, and ſuch as we delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately chuſe, and ſtudiouſly promote; wiſely projecting and contriving for it, and carefully and induſtriouſly labouring after it, to raiſe it to the higheſt pitch we can, and then to keep it there for ſome reaſonable time.</p>
               <p>For as ſincere Chriſtians who are upright in their Lives, and regular and zealous in the Works of GOD; are often viſited with <hi>ſudden Joys,</hi> and lifted up with unlookt for Conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; while a bright Beam is unexpectly dart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into them from above (and perhaps at ſuch a time when they are more than uſually in Clouds or Darkneſs:) So on the contrary, it ſometimes happens, that they are <hi>ſurprized</hi> with <hi>Grief</hi> when they little think of it. When they are ſeated in their beſt and eaſieſt Circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, where the Air is free, and the Sky is clear, and all about them is lightſome and pleaſant:
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:34484:18"/> even <hi>then</hi> their Serenity grows thick on a ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, and an unexpected Gloomineſs comes upon them. Or if the Heavens be not wholly overcaſt at once, yet ſome watry Clouds riſe in their Horizon, and their fair Weather is turned into Showers, which fall (as Rains very fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently do) when the Sun ſhines. Their Hearts are ſtruck, I mean, with pious Relentings un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>awares, and they ſlide in an Inſtant into Holy Sorrow; and that ſo unſenſibly, that they find themſelves in it, without any Proſpect at all of it; and feel their Souls much affected with it, without taking any manner of pains to raiſe it.</p>
               <p>Now ſuch a ſurreptitious and accidental Mourning, is not the Mourning which we here ſpeak to. For however the Pangs of it which ſeize the Chriſtian (at his Prayers, Meditations, or the like) may be Inſtances of the Divine Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour towards him, and may ſhew that he is dear to the HOLY GHOST, who is pleas'd to honour Him with unſought Influences: yet our principal Subject is an intended, premedita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and endeavoured Mourning. A Mourning that we ſtrive and labour for, uſing our utmoſt care and skill to make it as ſerious and <hi>ſolemn</hi> as we can. And when it is <hi>duly</hi> ſolemn, it hath theſe <hi>Seven</hi> Attendants, or <hi>Concomitants:</hi> 
                  <list>
                     <item>1. Tears.</item>
                     <item>2. Prayer.</item>
                     <item>3. Faſting.</item>
                     <item>4. Alms-deeds.</item>
                     <item>5. Set-times.</item>
                     <item>6. Free Forgiveneſs.</item>
                     <item>7. Select Aſſociates.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <pb n="23" facs="tcp:34484:18"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> Where Holy Mourning is duly <hi>ſolemn,</hi> it is often accompani'd with <hi>Tears. They</hi> are a moſt natural Expreſſion of Sorrow; and where-ever it riſes high in the Heart, it is uſual with it to run out at the Eyes. There it <hi>commonly</hi> diſchar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges it ſelf, tho' I dare not <hi>affirm,</hi> that it <hi>always</hi> does ſo. For ſome have ſuch a Maſculine hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in their Temper, that ſcarce <hi>any thing</hi> is able ſo far to melt them, as to ſet them a weep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. While others again are of ſo ſoft and fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minine a Conſtitution, that <hi>every thing</hi> almoſt can cauſe them to do it. They diſſolve apace, and ſink and drown as it were in Floods of Tears, even upon ſlight and trivial accounts, and from very unproportionable Motives and Occaſions. So that if we would not err here, we muſt lay down ſome <hi>Rule</hi> which may ſerve to guide us in this matter. And the ſafeſt Rule as well as the plaineſt, to judge our ſelves by in the Caſe before us, I think is this; <hi>If we do not weep upon Religious Accounts, as well as upon others, we may juſtly ſuſpect that all is not right with us.</hi> For this ſtrongly argues, that either we are not throughly affected with the things of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity; or that we are ſhort of that Tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Spirit, which ſhould diſpoſe us to weep in ſuch weighty Affairs. If therefore thou beeſt <hi>naturally</hi> prone to Tears, and canſt ſhed them freely for <hi>lighter</hi> concerns; as for the Unkind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Friends, the Abuſiveneſs of Enemies, or any kind of outward Afflictions or Uneaſineſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes; and doſt not expreſs thy Sorrow the ſame <hi>Way,</hi> and in ſuitable <hi>meaſures,</hi> when <hi>Religion</hi> requires it, and where there is <hi>more</hi> Cauſe and Reaſon for it: thou maiſt well conclude there is a fault in thee, and by all means let it be
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:34484:19"/> amended. But if no <hi>worldly</hi> conſiderations can work upon thee, ſo far as to make thee weep; thou art the more excuſable for not doing it upon <hi>Religious</hi> Accounts. Only thou muſt be ſure then to raiſe thy Grief to the higheſt pitch thou canſt, and to expreſs it in <hi>other</hi> loudeſt Accents. Thou muſt <hi>ſigh,</hi> that is, and thou muſt <hi>mourn,</hi> where thou haſt cauſe to do it, with all the holy Paſſion that thou art able. This, to thee, muſt ſupply the Place of Tears; and GOD, be aſſured, will accept it in their ſtead. And therefore I exhort no good People here ſimply and abſolutely to holy <hi>Weeping;</hi> but to holy <hi>Mourning.</hi> Tho' ſtill I ſay, that that kind of Mourning is to be accompani'd with holy Tears, where-ever Perſons are <hi>capable</hi> of ſhed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding them.</p>
               <p>The <hi>ſecond</hi> Concomitant of <hi>ſolemn</hi> Mourning is <hi>Prayer.</hi> Prayers and Tears were ever in high Eſteem, as well as in great uſe with Chriſtians. They have always been reputed the Church's <hi>Weapons;</hi> and when ſhe rightly encounters the worſt Evils with them, ſhe commonly prevails againſt them by happy Conqueſts. And with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doubt to mourn upon our Knees, with Hearts breathing out Heavenly Deſires, while our Eyes overflow with godly Tears; muſt needs add much to the <hi>Solemnity</hi> of the Performance. And pity it is but <hi>Prayer</hi> ſhould be called in to joyn this Exerciſe, when it will not only advance its Solemnity, but promote its Succeſs. For the Chriſtian that mourns ſolemnly, muſt be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to do it, either from the want of ſome <hi>Bleſſing,</hi> which he would gladly obtain; or from the ſenſe of ſome <hi>Miſery,</hi> which he would fain get rid of; or from the fear of ſome <hi>Evil</hi>
                  <pb n="25" facs="tcp:34484:19"/> which he is Solicitous to Prevent: and in all theſe three Caſes, devout Prayer is ſingularly helpful. If we want any Bleſſing, it will help to procure it. If we feel any Miſery, it will help to remove it. If we fear any Evil that is like to happen, it will help to avert it. And when Prayer is ſo great an <hi>Aſſiſtant</hi> of Mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and ſerves its Ends with a powerful Influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; who that deſign to mourn for their Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage (which all holy Mourners certainly do) would not call in <hi>Prayer</hi> to inforce the Duty?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> To make holy Mourning more throughly <hi>Solemn,</hi> we muſt annex <hi>Faſting</hi> to it. That will be a means both to raiſe it higher in Sorrow and Acceptance. For by refuſing to take our uſual Nouriſhment, we ſhall gain the more time to ſpend in the Duty, and may at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend it the Longer without interruption; as being free from the diſturbance of thoſe inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent Avocations, which our Repaſts occaſion. And then our Stomachs being empty of Meat and Drink, and the digeſtive Faculty unimploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; this will be a farther help in the caſe. For then the groſs Fumes which after full Meals do commonly Riſe, cannot aſcend or ſteam up into the Head. And ſo the Brain will be leſs clouded; and ſo the Spirits will be leſs clogged; and ſo the Mind will be leſs dulled. And the more ſprightly and active the Mind is, the more pure and piercing will the Thoughts be. And the more refined and penetrative our Thoughts are, the more deep will they ſtrike into contemplated Subjects, and the quicker Apprehenſions will they give us of them. And the Quicker Apprehenſions we have of Mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:34484:20"/> matters, the lower we ſhall ſink into a Mournful Temper, and the deeper will our Hearts be cut and wounded with pious Relent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings. So that Diſcreet Abſtinence from bodily Refections, will be very Serviceable to awaken our Spiritual Grief; which often lies dormant under the weight of moderate and ordinary Food, and is not eaſy to be rowzed up. Tho' the higher it grows in commendable degrees, the more grateful ſtill will it be to GOD, and alſo the more beneficial to our ſelves.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> To render our Mourning more <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn</hi> yet, we muſt cauſe <hi>Alms-deeds</hi> to bear it Company. I do not mean only that thou ſhouldſt be kind to the Poor in a conſtant ſetled Courſe of Charity, as all Chriſtians are obliged to be, in proportion to <hi>their</hi> Wants, and their <hi>own</hi> Abilities: but that thou ſhouldſt on thy Mourning-Days give ſomething <hi>Extraordinary</hi> to the relief of the Indigent. Or if thou doſt not diſpenſe it <hi>then,</hi> yet however <hi>devote</hi> it to that Uſe, and give it out <hi>afterward</hi> as Occaſion is offered. Thus we ſhall help our holy Mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing conſiderably, and make it more efficacious than otherwiſe it would be. For <hi>that</hi> (as all other Sacred Exerciſes) muſt be carried on by the Strength of Divine Grace. And that <hi>Grace</hi> ſhall deſcend in a more abundant Meaſure upon the <hi>Charitable</hi> Chriſtian, is fairly intimated, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.8. Where to excite People to liberal Contributions towards ſupplying the preſſing Exigencies of the Needy; the Apoſtle tells them, that GOD <hi>is able to make all</hi> Grace <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound towards them.</hi> Inſinuating, that our Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable Benevolences to the neceſſitous, ſhall be recompenced with abundance of all ſorts of
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:34484:20"/> Grace. And when the Graces of Heaven are conferred upon us; Holy Mourning, as well as other holy Offices, by Virtue of that Power which they derive to our Souls, ſhall be the more effectually performed by us. Let ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what therefore of more than <hi>ordinary</hi> Charity, always wait upon this Sort of Mourning. So the more of God's Grace, and the more of GOD's Bleſſing will reſt upon us in the Work; and that ſhall not only be better in it ſelf, but the more Serviceable to thoſe worthy Ends to which we direct it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fifthly,</hi> In caſe we would mourn <hi>ſolemnly,</hi> It will be neceſſary to have <hi>Set-times</hi> for doing it. Every Action requires Time, nor can it do otherwiſe in the Nature of the thing. For if it be of any Continuance, that Continuance in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes ſome Moments in it: and what can that ſucceſſive Duration be but <hi>Time,</hi> tho' never ſo ſhort? Yea if any Tranſaction be of ſo ſwift diſpatch as to be inſtantaneous; yet the leaſt poſſible Inſtant, muſt be the ſmalleſt Part of Time, as the leaſt poſſible Atom, is the ſmalleſt Part of Matter. Now as every Action requires Time naturally, ſo every religious one muſt do the ſame. But then withal, the more Serious we would be in any ſuch Action, the more Time proportionably we muſt beſtow upon it. For ſo we may conſider it the more throughly; and thorough Conſideration will ingage us in it the more zealouſly; and when Zeal is up, and upon the Wing, it will carry us to the End of it the more chearfully and vigorouſly. And therefore Religious Mourning being one of the moſt important Tasks of a Chriſtian, it behoves us to have <hi>Times,</hi> ſtated or <hi>Set-times</hi>
                  <pb n="28" facs="tcp:34484:21"/> wherein to exerciſe it. That will be one means to inable us to undertake it, and go through with it, with the more Conſideration, Zeal, and Vigorouſneſs.</p>
               <p>Now the Time to be allotted for this pious Exerciſe, may be <hi>doubly</hi> conſidered. Either as to the <hi>Quantity,</hi> how <hi>much</hi> thereof is to be ſpent in it at once: or as to the <hi>frequency</hi> of its Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn, <hi>when</hi> it muſt be reſumed, or how <hi>often</hi> repeated.</p>
               <p>As for the <hi>Quantity</hi> of Time to be imployed in it at once, it cannot well be leſs than <hi>one whole Day.</hi> The Space I mean of an <hi>Artificial</hi> Day, conſiſting of twelve Hours, and continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing (as with us it is uſually reckon'd) from Six a Clock in the Morning, to Six in the Evening. And truly we who expect that <hi>Labourers</hi> ſhould work for ſuch a Day; and can run out whole Days, in civil Solemnities of our own, as we do our <hi>Birth</hi>-days, our <hi>Wedding</hi>-days, or the like: how can we beſtow leſs than a <hi>whole</hi> Day in holy Mourning, when we intend to be <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn</hi> in that Sacred Duty?</p>
               <p>But then as to the Return of ſuch a Day, how <hi>often</hi> it muſt be reiterated, it is not ſo eaſy for us to ſet. For in this matter we have no <hi>certain Rule</hi> to go by: No common Standard applicable to all, whereby to take convenient Meaſures. For here Reſpect muſt be had to the various Conditions or Circumſtances of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons. Some in regard of their Secular Buſineſs, or Bodily Conſtitution (as having Leſs Imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and more Health) can better ſpend a Day in a <hi>Week</hi> in holy Mourning; than others can do it in a <hi>Quarter</hi> of a <hi>Year.</hi> Here there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Wiſdom and Piety muſt rule, and People
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:34484:21"/> muſt govern themſelves according to the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent circumſtances they are in, and the Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of their Prevailing Goodneſs and Diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. I can only ſay in this Caſe, as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle did in another; <hi>every Man according as He purpoſeth in his Heart, So let him do,</hi> 2 Cor. 9.7. When we have wiſely pondered all things, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating to the weighty Affair; let us reſolve to mourn either ſeldomer or oftener, as in our very <hi>Conſciences</hi> we ſhall Judge to be beſt. Only let us remember, that what St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſays there in reference to <hi>Mercy,</hi> is every whit as applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to <hi>Mourning.</hi> He that <hi>ſoweth plentifully,</hi> ſhall <hi>reap plentifully;</hi> and He that ſoweth <hi>ſparingly,</hi> ſhall reap <hi>ſparingly.</hi> For if they that ſow in Tears ſhall reap in Joy; then in proportion to our Seed muſt be our Crop, and our<note n="*" place="margin">Yet as two Mites were once pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore richer Offerings, <hi>Luk. 21:</hi> ſo <hi>one</hi> day ſpent by <hi>ſome</hi> in holy Mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, may be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

A Thought which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but draw us powerfully to the Work, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided that it dwells as long upon our Minds, and ſinks as deep into them as it ought.

               <p>Yet that we may not leave the Time for this work, wholly in <hi>ſuſpence,</hi> let us come to this <hi>moderate</hi> Determination concerning it. Leſt a <hi>Day</hi> in a <hi>Quarter</hi> of a <hi>Year</hi> ſhould be too <hi>

                  <hi>Sixthly,</hi> In caſe we would mourn <hi>ſolemnly,</hi> we muſt join a <hi>free Forgiveneſs</hi> with it. For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs, I mean, of all thoſe that offend us, be they never ſo bitter Enemies to us. For that will help to open the Door of GOD's Mercy, and let us into an happy poſſeſſion of the Like great Bleſſing, from Himſelf. Were there no Sin, there could be no Mourning, becauſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed there would be no Miſery. But our
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:34484:22"/> Mournings being cauſed by our Sins and our Miſeries; as oft as we mourn, we ſhould en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to get our <hi>Sins</hi> remitted, that ſo our <hi>Miſeries,</hi> which are their Effects, may either be ſanctifi'd or removed. Now one ſpecial means to procure GOD's Pardon for <hi>our ſelves,</hi> is for <hi>us</hi> to pardon <hi>others.</hi> Freely let <hi>us</hi> Pardon <hi>their</hi> Faults then, that <hi>He</hi> may do the ſame by <hi>ours.</hi> For this we have a <hi>Rule</hi> from Heaven, and ſo very clear and full it is, that I need but recite it: <hi>Forgive, and ye ſhall be forgiven, Luk.</hi> 6.37. And muſt not free Forgiveneſs of our <hi>Brethrens</hi> Offences, be a neceſſary Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of holy Mourning? when upon it <hi>our own</hi> Forgiveneſs depends, and without that For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs, all our Mourning will ſignify little? But then ſince it is ſo <hi>needful</hi> a Concomitant, let us be ſure to make it a <hi>conſtant</hi> one. And remember one thing more; that if God ſhould ever be ſo gracious to us, as competently to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure us of the remiſſion of our Sins; we muſt then be as willing freely to forgive our treſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſing Brethren, from the <hi>ſenſe</hi> of that great Mercy <hi>received;</hi> as ever we were to do it <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,</hi> from the <hi>hopes</hi> we had, that we ſhould at laſt <hi>obtain</hi> it. For <hi>this</hi> we have a divine <hi>Rule</hi> too: <hi>Forgiving one another,</hi> even <hi>as</hi> CHRIST <hi>forgave you, ſo do ye,</hi> Col. 3.13.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Laſtly,</hi> To compleat the <hi>Solemnity</hi> of this pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Mourning, we may take ſome <hi>fit Aſſociates</hi> to us in it. So we may inforce it happily by inlarging it; and by making it more compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſive, ſhall make it more effectual. GOD, who did not ſpare <hi>Sodom</hi> for <hi>Lot,</hi> one righteous Perſon, would not have deſtroyed it, could <hi>ten</hi> have been found in it. <hi>Two</hi> holy Mourners
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:34484:23"/> may do more than <hi>one;</hi> and <hi>Ten</hi> may prevail where <hi>Two</hi> cannot. 'Twill be Wiſdom therefore to increaſe our Number, that ſo we may be the better accepted.</p>

And ſurely the ſweeteſt Character it is, that any mortal can bear, and the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pieſt Circumſtance he can poſſibly be in.

And that he really was ſo, is evident, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 14.14. where <hi>He,</hi> and <hi>Noah,</hi> and <hi>Job,</hi> are all remarked by the HOLY GHOST, for extraordinary Interceſſours. Yet this powerful Man being to call upon GOD, in a matter of very mournful concern (when his own Life, and the Lives of many others lay at Stake) would not truſt to the force of his <hi>ſingle</hi> Invo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation; but deſired his<note n="†" place="margin">Dan. 2.17.</note>

Let us con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form to this excellent Pattern, and ingage as many good Friends as we are able, to join with us in holy Mourning. If there be any in the World that we are acquainted <hi>with,</hi> or related <hi>to,</hi> who are ſincere and faithful Chriſtians, or who for Holineſs of Life, or Zeal in Religion outſtrip others; let us invite them to be our Partners in this Heavenly Imployment. Let us uſe our <hi>own</hi> Intereſt; and where we have none, the Intereſt of <hi>others</hi> to draw them into the Fraternity of Holy Mourners. And if <hi>that</hi> will encourage and induce them to it, they may pleaſe to Conſider, that they can never be Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:34484:23"/> of a more <hi>choice Society</hi> upon the Face of the Earth.

               <p>They that enter upon holy Mourning, and carry it on attended with theſe <hi>ſeven</hi> Conco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitants; do ſeem to fill up the <hi>Solemnity</hi> of it according to its juſt and adequate Meaſures. For to dilate or amplify it <hi>farther</hi> than thus, would be to ſtretch it beyond the Capacities of a Man. For if we look upon a Man in his entire Capacities of an holy Mourner, how can he be more concerned than in His <hi>Soul,</hi> His <hi>Body,</hi> His <hi>Eſtate,</hi> his <hi>Time,</hi> his <hi>Enemies,</hi> and His <hi>Friends?</hi> And all theſe are plainly ingag'd in the Concomitants forementioned.

               <argument>
                  <p>Two Motives to holy Mourning <hi>in General; It is a</hi> Chriſtian Duty. <hi>And a Duty</hi> moſt acceptable <hi>unto</hi> GOD. <hi>Its</hi> Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptableneſs <hi>manifeſted in</hi> four Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>FRom the <hi>Nature</hi> and <hi>Concomitants</hi> of Holy Mourning, we ſhould now paſs to the <hi>two Branches</hi> of <hi>Private</hi> Mourning. Namely, to Mourning for our <hi>Own,</hi> and for <hi>Other Mens ſins.</hi> But before we enter upon <hi>them,</hi> it will be neceſſary to offer General <hi>Motives</hi> to Holy Mourning <hi>in General;</hi> (that is, to the ſeveral <hi>Sorts</hi> and <hi>Branches</hi> of it mention'd in the Cloſe of the firſt Chapter;) and to remove thoſe <hi>Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections</hi> which lie againſt it: tho' it takes a <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable</hi> Part of our Diſcourſe to do it. So we being the better <hi>prepared</hi> for the Work, and the <hi>Way</hi> to it being <hi>cleared</hi> from the Common <hi>Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtacles;</hi> we ſhall ſtep into it with more Readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. They that are fit for <hi>all Studies</hi> in <hi>Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,</hi> may the better enter upon <hi>any particular</hi> ones. So being diſpoſed to mourn upon <hi>all Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts,</hi> we may eaſily turn the Paſſion upon <hi>our ſelves,</hi> or <hi>others;</hi> or upon the <hi>Faults</hi> of <hi>either,</hi> as we ſhall think beſt. Whereas if we be not Qualified for Mourning <hi>in General,</hi> we ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver mourn to purpoſe in the <hi>two</hi> main <hi>particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar</hi> Caſes; that is to ſay, either for our <hi>Perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal,</hi> or for <hi>National Sins. Two</hi> Motives to ſuch Mourning <hi>in General</hi> ſhall fill up this Chapter.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> Conſider, Holy Mourning is a <hi>Duty in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbent upon Chriſtians.</hi> And therefore tho' it be not over-pleaſing to Fleſh and Blood; yet we muſt not neglect it, but forthwith undertake it, and reſolve to go through with it, as being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpenſably needful. <hi>That</hi> conſidered, we muſt not ſhrink from it becauſe it is difficult, but rather carry it on with a double diligence, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is neceſſary. And that it is a neceſſary Duty upon Chriſtians, may be gathered from <hi>Zech.</hi> 12.12. There the Prophet tells us, that the <hi>Land</hi> (the whole Land of <hi>Judea</hi>) ſhall mourn; and <hi>every Family</hi> in it <hi>apart, and their Wives apart.</hi> So that Perſons of all Sorts and Conditions were to mourn in <hi>that</hi> Country; and withal to be ſo <hi>ſolemn</hi> in it, as to act it <hi>ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parately,</hi> even in moſt cloſe and diſtinct Retire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.

                  <hi>in that Day,</hi> as we are there in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed; in the time of the <hi>Meſſiah.</hi> For it was to be after He was<note n="†" place="margin">Ver. 10.</note>

               <p>To which I need but add; that if our deareſt LORD did not <hi>command</hi> it in a way ſtrictly preceptive; yet He fairly impoſed it in a <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictive</hi> manner, S. <hi>Mat.</hi> 9.15. JESUS <hi>ſaid unto them, Can the Children of the Bride-Chamber mourn, as long as the Bridegroom is with them? But the days will come when the Bridegroom ſhall be taken from them, and then ſhall they Faſt.</hi> Where
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:34484:25"/> it is obſervable, that our Bleſſed SAVIOUR ſeems to make <hi>Faſting</hi> and <hi>Mourning</hi> equivalent. For when the Queriſts in the foregoing Verſe, asked Him about the <hi>one,</hi> He plainly anſwered them by the <hi>other.</hi> And truly Faſting was ſo uſual or conſtant a <hi>Companion</hi> of pious Mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that 'tis commonly joined with it as we find, both in the <hi>Canonical</hi> and <hi>Apocryphal</hi> Books. And withal it was ſo clear and natural a ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the ſame, that the <hi>Jews</hi> never practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed it upon their Weekly <hi>Sabbaths,</hi> nor the <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Chriſtians</hi> upon their LORD's Days, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they were Days of <hi>Joy.</hi> And to put on a Sign or Expreſſion of Mourning in Times of Religious Mirth or Feſtivity, would have been very unſuitable and abſurd. And when Faſting (before our LORD's Incarnation) was ſuch a Conſtant Companion of Mourning; no Wonder that when He was here in the Fleſh, He ſhould make them ſynonymous, by putting one for the other, as in the forecited Text. But He having done ſo, what He did will bear this Remark. When He ſaid then ſhall they <hi>faſt,</hi> it was the ſame in effect, as if He had ſaid, then ſhall they <hi>mourn.</hi> Which being ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken poſitively, not then <hi>may</hi> they do it, as mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of <hi>chance;</hi> or then <hi>will</hi> they do it, as matter of <hi>choice;</hi> but then <hi>ſhall</hi> they do it as matter of <hi>injunction,</hi> as well as <hi>prediction;</hi> it amounts to no leſs than a peremptory <hi>Command.</hi> Unleſs we ſuppoſe that what our REDEEMER ſpake at that time, was meant only to His Proſelytes then <hi>about</hi> Him. But that cannot be. For in the 25th of <hi>Matthew,</hi> the Subjects of the Kingdom of Heaven, or the Profeſſors of the Goſpel, are <hi>all</hi> likened unto <hi>Virgins,</hi> tho'

                  <hi>Children of the Bride-chamber,</hi> in the ninth Chapter; hence it is Evident, that <hi>all</hi> Chriſtians are Children of the Bride-cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and conſequently that <hi>all</hi> muſt <hi>mourn,</hi> as well as they who then <hi>attended</hi> the Bridegroom.

Enough to afflict us with Sorrows, tho' we had nothing elſe to trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble us; to think that we ſhould be ſo Remote from Him, who is ſo Affectionate, and ſo Dear to us.

               </p>
               <p>All which Particulars taken together, muſt be a clear Manifeſtation of the great <hi>Accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſs</hi> of Holy Mourning.</p>
               <p n="1">1ſt, GOD <hi>hath a Regard for it. A broken and contrite Heart,</hi> O GOD, <hi>thou wilt not deſpiſe, Pſal.</hi> 51.17. In the Words there is a <hi>Meioſis,</hi> or a certain Figure whereby they <hi>mean</hi> a great deal more than they <hi>ſpeak.</hi> As to outward Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance, and the view of the World, there is ſcarce a meaner or poorer thing in it, than a Pious Mourner. For he is ſo throughly and truly dejected, that all which might make him externally Gay, is clouded or eclipſed, if not ſunk and ſwallowed up of Sorrow and Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. But as little and contemptible as he may ſeem at any time in the Eyes of Men; he is never deſpicable in the ſight of GOD. Tho' his Heart be broken and contrite, ſhattered to pieces, as it were, and ground to Powder, by the vehement Anguiſh of violent Grief: yet ſtill that Glorious Being above, cannot <hi>ſlight</hi> it in the leaſt. He expreſsly declares the contrary, that He hath a <hi>Regard</hi> for it. <hi>To this Man will I look, even to Him that is of a contrite ſpirit,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:34484:26"/> Iſai.</hi> 66.2. The Prophet in the foregoing Verſe, ſignifies that the Heighth and Greatneſs of GOD's MAJESTY is ſuch, that Heaven is His Throne, and the Earth is His Footſtool. Now where a Being ſo tranſcendently <hi>high</hi> and <hi>great,</hi> looks upon any one with an Eye of Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, that is infinitely leſs and lower than it ſelf; 'tis certain it muſt have a <hi>Regard</hi> for that Perſon. Yet the Holy Mourner is that happy Man to whom this Signal Honour is ſhewn. To <hi>this Man</hi> will I look, ſaith the LORD. And 'tis well the LORD was pleaſed to ſay it: for had any but Himſelf, or one of His ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointing, dared to utter it; So vaſt is the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcenſion promiſed, that we might well have queſtion'd the Performance of it. But ſince the GOD of Truth thought fit to ſpeak it, who ſhall doubt of what He declares? He having affirmed that He will <hi>look</hi> to the Mourner, He is ſure enough of GOD's propitious Aſpect. Indeed none in the World are out of His view: none can hide themſelves, tho' they would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo fain do it, out of His ſight. <hi>Can any hide themſelves in ſecret places that I ſhall not ſee them? Jer.</hi> 23.24. He is All-ſeeing, and of neceſſity muſt ſee every one, where-ever they are, and what-ever they do. But then tho' GOD <hi>ſees</hi> all, He <hi>looks</hi> but to few; that is, with an Eye of <hi>ſpecial Regard,</hi> and in this Number are the truly contrite.</p>
               <p>Nor will it be hard to convince the contrite Man of as much, tho' he ſhould be ſomewhat Sceptical in the Caſe. For ſuppoſe that on Every of thy Mourning-Days periodically returning, thou ſhouldſt ſee a bright <hi>Angel</hi> ſent down from Heaven, ſtanding by thee with a <hi>Book</hi> and a
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:34484:27"/> 
                  <hi>Bottle</hi> in his holy Hands; ready to enter the Number of thy Tears in the <hi>one,</hi> and then to put them up and preſerve them in the <hi>other.</hi> Wouldſt thou not preſently think and conclude that GOD hath a <hi>Regard</hi> for thee in what thou art doing? Yet know, and be aſſured, that thy Tears which flow at ſuch <hi>ſolemn</hi> Times, ſhall be as certainly numbred and remembred by GOD, as if they were entred in a <hi>Book,</hi> or put up in a <hi>Bottle,</hi> by one of His glorious Miniſters from above. The HOLY GHOST atteſts as much in King <hi>David</hi>'s Petition and Interrogatory, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 56.8. <hi>Put thou my Tears into thy</hi> Bottle; <hi>are they not noted in thy</hi> Book?</p>
               <p>But then what a ſtrange <hi>Incentive</hi> muſt this be to Holy <hi>Mourning!</hi> to think that our Tears ſhall be recorded in Heaven, as ſurely as things are kept in Memory by being regiſtred, or moſt cloſely and carefully repoſited upon Earth. When thine Heart melts, and thy Tears drop, tho' they fall upon the Floor and mingle with the Duſt; yet none ſhall be forgotten, not <hi>one</hi> of them ſhall be loſt. The GOD who num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>breth<note n="*" place="margin">Mat. 10.30.</note> the Hairs of thine Head, will keep ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the Tears from thine Eyes. And for farther Encouragement, the only <hi>reaſon</hi> why He remembers them, is but that He may <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> thee for them. Which conſidered, who would not Endeavour to pull up the Sluces of Godly Sorrow, and even drown themſelves, if they could, in Holy Mourning? The leaſt we can reſolve on methinks, when we ruminate on this, is to do, on our Mourning-Days, as <hi>David</hi> and His People did (1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 30.4.) weep till we have no more power to weep.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="41" facs="tcp:34484:27"/>2ly, GOD <hi>highly Eſteems our Holy Mourning.</hi> He affords it not only a <hi>common Regard,</hi> but an <hi>extraordinary Reſpect.</hi> So He gives us clearly to underſtand, where He tells us expreſsly by His King and Prophet; that <hi>the Sacrifices of</hi> GOD <hi>are a broken ſpirit, Pſal.</hi> 51.17. When the Pangs of holy Grief once come ſo thick, and grow ſo ſtrong as to rent the Heart, and to wound the Soul, and to make as it were, <hi>breaches</hi> in the Spirit of a Man; this will be a valuable Temper with GOD: a Frame of Mind that He will approve and love; that He will really prize, and make as great account of, as ever He did of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Sacrifices under the old <hi>Moſaic</hi> Diſpenſation. And that He had an high Eſteem for <hi>them,</hi> we need not queſtion, inaſmuch as Himſelf was the Author of them. By His or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Sacrifices were introduced, and ſet up in the Church; and ſo were Rites of His own In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution. The ſeveral Kinds of them, and their reſpective Materials; the Times, when; the Places, where; the Occaſions, upon which; the Ways, how; the Parties, <hi>for</hi> whom, and the Perſons, <hi>by</hi> whom they were to be offered; were all of His preſcribing. And when they were duly performed according to His pleaſure and divine Appointment, He could not but ſet an huge Eſtimate upon them. But then it is as evident that He hath an equal Eſteem for the Spirit that is broken with Holy Mourning, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe He calls it the <hi>Sacrifices</hi> of GOD. Not only His <hi>Sacrifice,</hi> making it equivalent to <hi>this</hi> or <hi>that,</hi> or the other <hi>ſingle</hi> Sacrifice under the Law; but His <hi>Sacrifices;</hi> intimating that in His Eſteem it equals <hi>many,</hi> if not <hi>all</hi> of them at once.</p>
               <pb n="42" facs="tcp:34484:28"/>
               <p>And I muſt farther add this great Truth. That if <hi>legal Sacrifices</hi> were ſo <hi>eſteemed</hi> of GOD; the <hi>broken Spirit</hi> muſt be <hi>much more eſtimable,</hi> as being much more <hi>excellent.</hi> For <hi>They</hi> were only outward and typical Services; Symbols, Figures, and Shells of Religion; at beſt but poſitive, and ſo temporary things, good for a time becauſe they were commanded. But the broken Spirit contains in it intrinſic Piety, mental Virtue, and moral Duty. And ſo the mention'd Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices muſt be as much ſhort of it, as a meer Ske<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leton is of a Man; or as Shadows and Appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances are of moſt ſolid and ſubſtantial Realities. For here the Religious do not bring their Oxen, or their Heifers, their Calves, or their Kids, their Sheep or their Lambs to be ſlain; But things that are very much dearer to them: I mean their Paſſions and their Appetites, their Affections and their Luſts, their ſelfiſh Intereſts, and their ſenſual Delights, and all their Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures and Practices that are <hi>ſinful.</hi> Theſe are checked, theſe are weakened, theſe are wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, conquered, and killed by holy Contrition. When the Chriſtian mourns, theſe gaſp and dye: the Tears He ſheds are the very Life<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bloud of his Corruptions. And therefore the broken Spirit muſt needs ſet us higher in GOD's Eſteem, than Holocauſts, or Heca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tombs, or the richeſt Sacrifices at any Altar. And there is Reaſon for it. For in <hi>them</hi> Men ſacrificed their <hi>Beaſts,</hi> but in <hi>this</hi> they ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice <hi>Themſelves;</hi> which recommends them to the beſt Acceptance.</p>
               <p>And ſhall not this effectually draW thee to Religious Mourning? When thou doeſt it heartily, beeſt thou never ſo low in thy Perſon
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:34484:28"/> or thy Circumſtances, thou ſhalt be very highly eſteemed of GOD. Surely when the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> High Prieſt in his richeſt Garments did rightly make his choiceſt Offerings, no ſpiritual Man could be more honourable in his Self, or more acceptable in his Function. Yet when <hi>Aaron,</hi> array'd with all the pompous Ornaments of the Pontifical Habit, ſtood in the holieſt Place up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Earth, and there preſented the ſweeteſt In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſe to the MOST HIGH; he could not be more approved, or better eſteemed, than the pooreſt zealous Chriſtian ſhall be, when with a <hi>broken Spirit</hi> he pours out his Sighs, or mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Tears unto the ſame GOD. Nay if we meaſure Mens acceptance with GOD, by the Quality or Goodneſs of the Oblations they make Him; the <hi>Chriſtian Mourner</hi> in his meaneſt Rags, will be more acceptable than the <hi>Jewiſh Sacrificer</hi> in his Stately Robes. Perhaps in this World there is not a Man that ſhines ſo bright in the Eyes of Heaven, as the Chriſtian does in a Mourning Cloud.</p>
               <p n="3">3ly, GOD <hi>dwells with Holy Mourners.</hi> When one that is great, and good, and wiſe, ſhall take up his Reſidence with ſuch as are unſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably beneath him, and unworthy of him; this alone ſufficiently argues that he is much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted with their Company, and their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe; that what they <hi>are,</hi> and what they <hi>do,</hi> is extreamly pleaſing and grateful to Him. Let the Rule be applied to the moſt Great, and Good, and Wiſe GOD, and it will ſhew his <hi>Acceptance</hi> of Holy Mourning; for He profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth to <hi>dwell</hi> with them that exerciſe it. <hi>Thus ſaith the</hi> HIGH <hi>and</hi> LOFTY ONE <hi>that

               <p>And can any amongſt us refuſe to mourn, or refrain from doing it, that conſider this? If thou beeſt ſolidly good, think with thy ſelf; what is there in the whole World comparable to this? Where canſt thou look for any thing like it, or where ſhalt thou find it? To have GOD <hi>dwell with</hi> us; to have the Glorious GOD <hi>dwell in</hi> us; O unſpeakable Privilege! 'Tis much too high for the brighteſt Cherubin; only <hi>He</hi> is pleaſed not to think it ſo. But what is it then for ſinful Souls, in vile, and frail, and fleſhly Bodies? Where-ever a King dwells, there is a <hi>Court;</hi> and where-ever GOD dwells, in the ſenſe we ſpeak it, there muſt be <hi>Heaven.</hi> Yet as mean as thine Heart is or as bad and baſe as it may have been, GOD is ready to deſcend into it, and to abide there, if by Holy Mourning it be fitted for Him. And ſhould we weep till we wept our Eyes out, methinks we ſhould count it a cheap Price wherewith to purchaſe ſo rich a Bleſſing. Tho' we plainly ſee, that we need not go ſo <hi>far</hi> for it neither; for a moderate Grief, ſo much as makes the Spirit <hi>contrite,</hi> will entitle us to it and ſettle it upon us. Enough to amaze any thinking Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian.</p>
               <p>O ponder it well, and then ſpeak! Can the GOD of Heaven do thee a greater Honour; or canſt thou ask a greater Favour of Him, than to <hi>dwell</hi> with thee for ever? Bleſſed, Bleſſed, and for ever Bleſſed be His MAJESTY for it.</p>

                  <pb n="45" facs="tcp:34484:29"/>4ly, GOD hath <hi>ranked Holy Mourning a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the nobleſt Perfections of the beſt Religion.</hi> The LORD JESUS is GOD <hi>Bleſſed for ever,</hi> Rom. 9.5. And when in tender Pity to loſt Men, He aſſumed their Nature, to reſtore their Happineſs; and in order to accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that glorious Work, was newly entred up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on His Mediatorſhip: He publicly preached a moſt excellent Sermon to a Multitude of Hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers. And in that divine and incomparable Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, amongſt other ſacred uſeful Doctrines, He recommended <hi>eight Beatitudes</hi> to them. Truths and Duties of ſo high a Nature, and heavenly an Efficacy, as will certainly render all ſincere Believers, and hearty Conſcientious Practitioners of them, <hi>Spiritually</hi> firſt, and then <hi>Eternally Bleſſed.</hi> Now as we find in the Fifth of S. <hi>Matthew,</hi> the <hi>Second,</hi> in order of theſe <hi>Eight</hi> Beatitudes, is the <hi>Holy</hi>

For tho' <hi>Grotius,</hi> and ſome others (<hi>from</hi> or <hi>with</hi> him) reſtrain it to Mourning <hi>in Adverſity,</hi> or <hi>under Affliction</hi> (which is <hi>one</hi> very good and approvable <hi>Senſe,</hi> that we not only <hi>allow,</hi> but <hi>uſe</hi> it in, where we urge to Mourning in <hi>General:</hi>) yet learned Expoſitors do commonly underſtand it of Mourning for <hi>Sin.</hi> Lugentes peccata, vel ſua, vel aliena, <hi>Mourning for</hi> Sins, <hi>either their own, or other Mens.

               <argument>
                  <p>A <hi>Third Motive</hi> to Holy Mourning in Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral; <hi>It entitles us to divine Comforts in this Life.</hi> As appears from the <hi>Nature</hi> of <hi>GOD;</hi> from the <hi>Word,</hi> the <hi>Office,</hi> and the <hi>Diſpoſition</hi> of <hi>CHRIST;</hi> and from the <hi>Miſſion</hi> of the <hi>HOLY GHOST.</hi>
                  </p>
               </argument>
               <p>OUR precarious manner of exiſting in the World, does ſufficiently evince that we are not Authors of our own Beings; but that we had them Originally from GOD, who is the Source or Fountain of all Eſſence, both to Himſelf, and to all Creatures. And we being wholly derived <hi>from</hi> Him; we muſt of Neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty depend <hi>upon</hi> Him. And this our Entire de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance upon <hi>Him,</hi> muſt give Him abſolute Dominion over <hi>us.</hi> And ſo whatever He ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies to be His Will in reference to us; we are indiſpenſably obliged moſt heartily to Comply with, according to our ſeveral Meaſures and Capacities. And as every ſuch Compliance with regard to His Sovereignty is an <hi>inſtance</hi> of our <hi>Duty;</hi> ſo His Goodneſs hath made it an <hi>inſtrument</hi> of our <hi>Happineſs.</hi> For when at any time we yield Obedience to His MAJESTY, He hath not only promiſed to <hi>accept</hi> it Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, but moreover to <hi>recompence</hi> it graciouſly unto us. And as we ſhall have <hi>Reward</hi> for <hi>every</hi> Piece of Obedience, ſo we ſhall not miſs of one for <hi>Holy Mourning,</hi> provided we be but faithful in the Performance. And truly a moſt
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:34484:31"/> excellent Reward it ſhall be, as conſiſting of Divine COMFORTS from above.</p>
               <p>And that <hi>they</hi> ſhall attend upon Holy Mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as a fair <hi>Remuneration</hi> of it in this <hi>preſent</hi> Life, we have good Aſſurance. For there are many irrefragable Arguments to prove it, tho' I ſhall name but <hi>theſe</hi> that follow.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. The <hi>Nature</hi> of GOD.</item>
                  <item>2. The <hi>Word,</hi> the <hi>Office,</hi> and <hi>Diſpoſition</hi> of CHRIST. And,</item>
                  <item>3. The <hi>Miſſion</hi> of the HOLY GHOST.</item>
               </list>
               <p>Firſt, The <hi>Nature</hi> of GOD. As we have learnt already out of <hi>Iſai.</hi> 57.15. the Holy Mourner is GOD's <hi>Habitation.</hi> And where <hi>He</hi> dwells, who is the GOD <hi>of all Comfort,</hi> what Conſolations can be wanting? Divine Comforts do as naturally and neceſſarily attend His gracious Preſence, as radiant Brightneſs does the Body of the Sun. And that, we know, where-ever it goes, caſts a Sphere of glorious Light about it, and is able to make even Noon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day it ſelf, where before there was darkeſt Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night.</p>
               <p>Nor is GOD, where thus preſent the Cauſe of theſe Comforts <hi>naturally</hi> only, but (if we may uſe the Diſtinction) <hi>intentionally</hi> too; by ſecond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Efficacy</hi> of His <hi>Nature</hi> in the Caſe, by the <hi>Power</hi> of His <hi>Will;</hi> and ſo making the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts he ſheds down upon His Servants, to be the Iſſues of his Kindneſs, as well as of his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidence. And accordingly He proclaims in the cited Text, that the very <hi>End</hi> of His abode with the <hi>Humble</hi> and <hi>Contrite,</hi> is to <hi>revive</hi> their <hi>Hearts,</hi> and to <hi>revive</hi> their <hi>Spirits.</hi> The Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:34484:31"/> of which is as Happy, as Obvious: for the Beams of GOD's Favour being darted into Mourners by a <hi>double Efficacy,</hi> that of His <hi>Nature</hi> and His <hi>Will</hi> at once; they muſt needs enter with a <hi>double Force,</hi> and ſo chear good Souls both with the ſweeter, and the ſtronger Influence. The certain Conſequence of which again will be, that Men may as well freeze in the midſt of Fire, as holy Mourners can be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute of divine Comforts. I mean ordinarily; tho' for ſome ſpecial and extraordinary <hi>Reaſons,</hi> GOD ſometimes <hi>may,</hi> yea, often <hi>does</hi> ſuſpend, and withdraw his Comforts from them. But then, I ſay, the Diſpenſaton muſt be lookt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as extraordinary, and will be different <hi>from,</hi> and contrary <hi>to</hi> the uſual Methods of His Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedure, and the Common Meaſures of his Deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings with Mourners. And yet they need not be troubled at it neither. For however GOD may withhold His Conſolations from them for a Time; they are ſure notwithſtanding to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy them at laſt. And even that intermediate want which they feel, ſhall be <hi>better</hi> to them, ſome way or other, than the Fruition of them could have been.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> That Holy Mourners ſhall be comforted, we have farther Aſſurance from the <hi>Word,</hi> the <hi>Office,</hi> and the <hi>Diſpoſition</hi> of CHRIST.</p>
               <p>His <hi>Word</hi> to our purpoſe is moſt Expreſs and Memorable. For 'tis that which He ſpake in the Days of His Fleſh, when He preacht the beſt Sermon that ever was heard.<note n="*" place="margin">Mat. 5.4.</note> 
                  <hi>Bleſſed are they that mourn, for they ſhall be</hi> comforted. So that true Spiritual Mourning entitles thoſe that
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:34484:32"/> are ſerious in it, to true Spiritual Comforts. It muſt miniſter effectually to them, and it can do no otherwiſe, our SAVIOUR having ſaid it. Did He ever break His Word to His Proſelytes? Was He ever guilty of the Leaſt Inconſtancy? Are not <hi>all the Promiſes</hi> in Him,<note n="*" place="margin">Heb. 1.20.</note> 
                  <hi>Yea,</hi> and in Him, <hi>Amen?</hi> Where-ever He is pleaſed then to aſſert a thing ſo plainly; Where-ever He is pleaſed to promiſe it ſo poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively as He does, that Mourners ſhall be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted; there is no colour for doubting or que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtioning it in the Leaſt, as coming from the very Truth it ſelf.</p>
               <p>And beſides His Word, we have the Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory <hi>Office</hi> of the LORD JESUS, to aſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain divine Comforts, to holy Mourners. An Account of part of this <hi>Office</hi> is ſet down in the Beginning of the 61ſt of <hi>Iſaiah.</hi> Some Learned Expoſitors, and <hi>Grotious</hi> for one, would have the Words there, to be ſpoken by the Prophet, of <hi>Himſelf.</hi> But as they cannot properly be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to Him without ſtraining the ſenſe (as the Connexion of them with what goes before, will clearly ſhew, if we do but conſult the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herence, and conſider it:) ſo 'tis very Evident that they belong to our SAVIOUR, the Head of the Prophets, by His <hi>appropriating</hi> the ſame to His own Perſon. For He expounds them <hi>of</hi> Himſelf, S. <hi>Mat.</hi> 11.5. And affirms them to be fulfilled <hi>in</hi> Himſelf, S. <hi>Luk.</hi> 4.21. The firſt Clauſe that occurs in the quoted Chapter of <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> is this: <hi>The ſpirit of the</hi> LORD GOD <hi>is upon me, becauſe the</hi> LORD <hi>hath a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointed me to preach good Tidings.</hi> He was incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parably furniſht, that is, to preach the Goſpel. Not that the Goſpel was never preacht till the
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:34484:32"/> MESSIAH did it; for 'tis expreſsly ſaid, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.8. that <hi>the Goſpel was preached unto Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham.</hi> But then by CHRIST it was to be publiſht in its Perfection. In its ampleſt Lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, and with its higheſt Improvements. And was to be delivered in ſuch a way of Recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation, as ſhould be moſt plain and intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligible, and moſt powerful and impreſſive, and ſo moſt uſeful and advantageous to men. And our Mediator being thus to promulgate the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel (where all legal Shadows were turned into Subſtance; all Types, into Truth; all Schemes and Figures, into perfect Realities; and all Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions and Prophecies relating to Himſelf, and the Myſtery of our Redemption, into final Accompliſhments:) So good, and ſolid, and ſerviceable a Doctrine, muſt needs affect Mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers as well as others; and <hi>they</hi> muſt have their <hi>ſhare</hi> in thoſe <hi>general</hi> Conſolations which it ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders promiſcuouſly unto <hi>all.</hi> For one ſpecial End which our bleſſed Mediator propoſed to Himſelf in His Promulgation of the Goſpel; was that <hi>all</hi> who believ'd it, might be happy in ſpiritual <hi>Joys</hi> and <hi>Comforts,</hi> and in a Plenitude or <hi>Fulneſs</hi> of them. Witneſs Himſelf S. <hi>Joh.</hi> 15.11. <hi>Theſe things have I ſpoken unto you, that my</hi> Joy <hi>might remain in you, and that your</hi> Joy <hi>might be</hi> full.</p>
               <p>But this is not the <hi>whole</hi> of what I would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark from that Paragraph in <hi>Iſaiah;</hi> that Holy Mourners are intitled by <hi>common Right</hi> to thoſe <hi>ordinary Comforts</hi> of the Goſpel, which <hi>all</hi> its Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors may claim as well: but <hi>that</hi> which I ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, and would have all Mourners take notice of, is <hi>this;</hi> That a <hi>ſingular</hi> kind of <hi>Solace</hi> is provided for <hi>them;</hi> and that as they have a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:34484:33"/> 
                  <hi>Title</hi> to it, ſo it ſhall ſurely be <hi>imparted</hi> to them; it being the ſpecial and peculiar <hi>Care</hi> of our SAVIOUR to do it, by Vertue of His <hi>Office.</hi> For in the ſecond Verſe of the forecited Chapter, it is expreſsly declar'd, that he is to comfort <hi>all that</hi> mourn. And can <hi>any</hi> that mourn then think He will not do it? No more will He fail in doing <hi>that</hi> than He did, when time was, in <hi>preaching</hi> the Goſpel. Now when <hi>that</hi> was to be done, how did He per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form it? Did he not do it plainly? did He not do it powerfully? did He not do it moſt fully and faithfully? Yet allow but thus much (as who, can, or dare do otherwiſe?) and He can never, He can never <hi>neglect</hi> to <hi>comfort</hi> Mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers. For according to the Evangelical Prophet, He was <hi>anointed</hi> to the <hi>one</hi> as well as to the <hi>o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:</hi> anointed as much to comfort all that mourn, as ever He was, to preach good Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings, or the Goſpel in the World. Upon this Ground therefore that the HOLY JESUS hath undertaken it as a Piece of His <hi>Office,</hi> every pious Mourner that is not actually comforted already, may be very confident, that he ſhall be ſo.</p>
               <p>To which add; the <hi>Diſpoſition</hi> of our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer is ſuch, as inclines Him to do it. He hath given plain demonſtration of as much. For as He was pleaſed to take our Nature upon Him (a ſtrange Argument of the ſweetneſs of His own) ſo once he liv'd here in an human Body, and convers'd familiarly for ſeveral Years, with the Children of Men. And how did He then de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mean Himſelf towards them? With all the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleneſs and Kindneſs imaginable. His Affection to them was not only ſincere and cordial, but
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:34484:33"/> tranſcendent or ſuperlative; and the Expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of it were like it ſelf. For it did not Run out in aiery Compliments, and the empty Flaſhineſs of ſuperficial Formalities (which at beſt are no other than the Froth of Friendſhip, or a Colour of Kindneſs; and would be very fulſome, if they were not faſhionable) but ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſt it ſelf all-a-long in deep Concern for their real Welfare, and in great Solicitude for their Endleſs Happineſs. He pitied their Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries, He healed their Diſeaſes, He inſtructed their Ignorance, He informed their Judgments; and was deſirous to cure the Infirmities of their Minds, as well as thoſe of their Bodies. Yea, He died a ſhameful, He died a painful, and ſo a doubly miſerable and cruel Death, to expiate their Guilt, and reconcile them to GOD. And when out of His tender <hi>diſpoſition</hi> towards us, He willingly <hi>did</hi> and <hi>ſuffered</hi> ſuch wonderful things for us, can He refuſe to <hi>comfort</hi> thoſe of us that <hi>mourn?</hi> Then His <hi>diſpoſition</hi> muſt be mightily <hi>altered</hi> from what it was. Yet <hi>that</hi> we need not fear neither, as being quite im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible. For how read we, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.8? JESUS CHRIST <hi>the ſame yeſterday, to day, and for ever.</hi> Tho' Inſtability be this World's Property, and all the Things and Perſons in it, be ſeated under the PoWer of Change; yet the LORD CHRIST is far above it, and in <hi>Him</hi> there can be no manner of Mutation. He is ſaid to be the<note n="*" place="margin">Mal. 4.2.</note> 
                  <hi>Sun of Righteouſneſs,</hi> but then He dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers widely from the Sun in the Firmament. For whereas <hi>that</hi> every Day riſes and ſets, and hath his ſhining Face full of Maculaes, or Spots: The Sun our SAVIOUR is all Glory, and with Him is<note n="†" place="margin">Ja. 4.17. <gap reason="foreign">

                  <hi>finiſht,</hi> when He was giving up the Ghoſt. And as for thoſe His Sufferings, they ſhall never be repeated. For being ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient for <hi>ever</hi> when they were once endured, becauſe of their Value; they need not be reite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated. But then we may conſider, that by His Interceſſion, His Sufferings are perpetually re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented to GOD in our behalf; and by His Word, the Benefits of them are annuntiated; and by His SPIRIT the Efficacy of them
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:34484:34"/> is applied, according to out Worthineſs and Capacity of receiving them. And ſo as much <hi>Virtue</hi> is derivable from His Paſſion to our Souls, every <hi>Day</hi> and <hi>Hour</hi> we live; as if to this Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nute He were hanging and dying on the meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious Croſs. And as the Power and Profit of JESUS's Sufferings are the <hi>ſame</hi> to <hi>us,</hi> tho' the Pain of them be ceaſed as to <hi>Him:</hi> ſo <hi>He Himſelf</hi> is the very <hi>ſame</hi> that ever He was. The ſame in Patience, the ſame in Pity, the ſame in Kindneſs, and GOD-like Benevolence to the Sons of Men. But then He having ſuch a fixt Philanthropy, and ſuch flaming Love to the Souls of Men; how ſhall He refuſe, or how can He forbear to impart his <hi>Comforts</hi> to Holy Mourners? Eſpecially when it will coſt Him no more to do it, than barely to <hi>permit</hi> them to ſpring out of Himſelf, who is a moſt Bleſſed and inexhauſtible Fountain of them. Nor is it only eaſy to Him, but matter of delight; for in it, He not only follows the <hi>Duct</hi> of His <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;</hi> but takes as great Pleaſure in diſpenſing Comforts, as we find Benefit in receiving them from Him.</p>
               <p>Now the true and happy Caſe being this; the LORD CHRIST having given His <hi>Word</hi> that Mourners ſhall be Comforted; and it being His <hi>Office</hi> to ſee it done; and the very <hi>Diſpoſition,</hi> or <hi>Bent</hi> of His Nature leading Him to do it; and the Work miniſtring to <hi>His Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction,</hi> as well as to <hi>our Intereſt;</hi> it muſt not only be unlikely, but quite impoſſible for Him to withhold divine Comforts from Mourners. Unleſs (as hath been hinted) there be great and wiſe Reaſons known to Himſelf, why He ſhould do it.</p>
               <pb n="56" facs="tcp:34484:35"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Holy Mourners are ſure of Comforts, from the <hi>Miſſion</hi> of the HOLY GHOST into the World. That He came down upon Earth, and that when He did ſo, GOD ſent Him from Heaven; we all know. But then in what Quality or Capacity, under what No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or Character, upon what Buſineſs, or to what End did He come from above? That, Himſelf hath taught us by the Pen of Saint <hi>John:</hi> He came as a Comforter. And ſo that. Lofty Evangeliſt ſtiles Him<note n="*" place="margin">Joh. 14.16, 26.15.26.16.7.</note> more than once; intimating that all divine Comforts are deriv'd from Him; as indeed they are. And therefore di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine <hi>Joy,</hi> the ſame thing with divine <hi>Comfort,</hi> is expreſsly ſaid to be a <hi>Fruit of the</hi> SPIRIT, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.22. And to be <hi>Joy in the</hi> HOLY GHOST, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.17. And to be <hi>Joy of the</hi> HOLY GHOST, 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 1.6. And as theſe Joys and Comforts are Anticipations of thoſe above, and Praelibations, or Foretaſts of the Happineſs to come; they (with other things there meant) are ſaid to be the <hi>Earneſt of the</hi> SPIRIT, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.22. and <hi>the Firſt-fruits of the</hi> SPIRIT, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.23. And all becauſe they are wrought in us, or deſcend upon us, by the Spirit's ſecret, tho' moſt ſenſible Operations. Now this infinitely Glorious and Gracious SPIRIT being pleaſed to take ſuch an humble Flight; to come down into theſe inferior Regions, ſo unſuitable <hi>to</hi> Him, and unworthy <hi>of</hi> Him; and the Deſign of His marvellous Condeſcention, being not only to <hi>viſit,</hi> but to <hi>comfort</hi> Men: can any imagine that He ſhould either forget, or neglect His Work? Or if He comforts <hi>others,</hi> is it likely that He ſhould over-look Holy <hi>Mourners? They</hi> rather of all People ought to be <hi>firſt</hi> and <hi>moſt</hi> regarded
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:34484:35"/> by Him. For as they need Comforts more than others, ſo that Neceſſity is occaſion'd or brought upon them by <hi>Himſelf;</hi> all pious Mourning being but<note n="*" place="margin">See Chap. I.</note> a work of His.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That</hi> conſidered, He is tied to comfort all Holy Mourners, by an indiſſoluble Band of His own making. And let none ſurmiſe that He will ever offer to break looſe from it. For to hinder that, there is in Him an Impediment both eſſential and invincible. What it is we find in<note n="†" place="margin">V. 10.</note> For there He is called the <hi>good</hi> SPIRIT. And that being infallibly true, it implies Him poſſeſs'd of an anſwerable Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple. And this granted, if He had not been <hi>ſent</hi> to comfort Mourners, they might have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected it from His meer <hi>Temper;</hi> and in caſe He ſhould omit to do it in Kindneſs, they might almoſt challenge it of Him in Juſtice. What good Man could bring Trouble to any, and not ſupport them under it? And can the good Spirit caſt down into Mourning, and not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort His dejected? For Him to do that will be but pure Equity; as it is for Him that makes Wounds, to dreſs and heal them. And ſo in plain Terms, the HOLY GHOST can no more refuſe comforting of Mourners, than a Being of moſt Perfect and Infinite Goodneſs, can be guilty of that which is a ſort of Injuſtice, as well as Unkindneſs.</p>
               <p>Now muſt not Holy Mourners be certain of Comforts, when they are thus ſtrangely <hi>ſecured</hi> to them? For every Perſon, we ſee, in the Bleſſed TRINITY, and all of them at once, are jointly and ſeverally ingag'd to diſpenſe Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtial Comforts to all ſuch. The FATHER, upon Account of His <hi>Nature;</hi> The SON, upon
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:34484:36"/> Account of His <hi>Word,</hi> and <hi>Office;</hi> and the HOLY GHOST, upon Account of His <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignation</hi> and <hi>Miſſion</hi> to the Work. And then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the mentioned Obligations upon each of them; they are every one ſpontaneouſly inclin'd to do it.</p>
               <p>Yet what hath been twice already ſuggeſted, muſt here again be once more remembred. That Holy Mourners ſhall be comforted, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided it be <hi>beſt</hi> for them, and that there be no weighty <hi>Reaſons,</hi> why they ſhould be barred and hindred from it. For ſuch may the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, or Conditions of ſome be, that even divine Comforts may be dangerous to them. And ſo Heaven may be forc'd to keep them ſhort of thoſe Comforts, leſt inſtead of advantaging, they ſhould greatly injure them. For Chriſtian Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, how incomparable, was St. <hi>Paul?</hi> Yet<note n="*" place="margin">2 Cor. 12.7.</note> 
                  <hi>a Thorn in the Fleſh, a Meſſenger of Satan was ſent to buffet him, leſt he ſhould be exalted above Meaſure.</hi> And if ſuch a one as <hi>he</hi> could not be truſted with abundance of Revelations, without ſo ſevere a <hi>Curb</hi> upon his towring Spirit; we may eaſily apprehend that divine Comforts may often times be of perillous Conſequence to <hi>ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary</hi> Chriſtians, tho' holy Mourners.</p>
               <p>And therefore, by the way, if it ſhould prove thy Lot, to Mourn at any time without Light, and no Beam of Comfort ſhould ſhine into thy Soul: be not disquieted, be not at all diſcoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged by it. Tho thy circumſtance be uneaſy, Thou maiſt yet be happy; and much the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pier for this Diſappointment. GOD ſees what Thou diſcerneſt not, and the lowring Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence ſhall never hurt Thee. 'Tis only out of kindneſs that He keeps Thee in the Dark, and
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:34484:36"/> ſo Thou ſhalt find it to be in the Event. For however He may hide His Face for a while, and draw a Thin cloud betwixt Himſelf, and Holy Mourners; He will not hold them long in ſuch a gloomy State: not one minute lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, than till they are Qualifi'd to receive <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolations,</hi> and <hi>Benefit</hi> by them. When that's once done, He'll quickly unveil His Bleſſed Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, and by the bright Displays of its af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting Glories, warm their Hearts with Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural Gladneſs. And ſhould their Melancholy State chance to be more chronical, or laſting than they look for; yet let none impute its Protraction or Continuance to GOD's un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kindeſs. For ſo indulgent is He to his dear Children that He loves not to detain any thing from them which they need or deſire, in caſe it were better to impart it to them. When <hi>Mourners</hi> particularly are deſtitute of His Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts, and complain that they want them, and pine and languiſh for the injoyment of them; 'tis only ſome unhappy <hi>Indiſpoſition</hi> of their <hi>own,</hi> that cauſes Him to withhold them; and were but <hi>that</hi> removed, they ſhould not live one Hour without them. Could GOD but find, that the Comforts they wiſh, would. not be pernici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous; or could He perceive they would bd pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable to them; they ſhould be forthwith bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedly repleniſh'd with them. Then the Load of Anguiſh which damps their Minds, and the Burthen of Terror which oppreſſes their Souls, and the Weight of Heavineſs which ſinks their Spirits, ſhould immediately be taken off; and out of their Grief, and Fear, and Trouble, they ſhould ſoon emerge, and riſe into Angelic Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphs and Delights.</p>

               <p>But then this is not all. Holy Mourners are not only ſure of <hi>preſent Comforts;</hi> but ſuch Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts ſhall attend their Mourning as will make them <hi>Bleſſed;</hi> according to the Doctrine of our deareſt LORD in His Sermon on the Mount, Bleſſed <hi>are they that Mourn, for they ſhall be</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted.

<pb n="61" facs="tcp:34484:37"/> which throughly rectify and improve our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and exalt it in its beſt and nobleſt Capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cities, and ſo qualify us to be Bleſſed: But the <hi>remunerative</hi> and <hi>pleaſurable</hi> Delights of Bleſſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, which lie <hi>in,</hi> or reſult <hi>from</hi> the lively ſenſe, or free injoyment of divine Satisfactions de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcending from above.</p>
               <p>And if upon this Head of the Bleſſedneſs of Spiritual Comforts, I be ſomewhat <hi>prolix,</hi> let me not be thought <hi>tedious.</hi> For it is a <hi>grand In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centive</hi> to the Work we recommend, and <hi>one</hi> of the <hi>main Springs</hi> which muſt give <hi>motion</hi> to us in it, and then keep up and continue the ſame. For Holy Mourning, the truth is, may ſeem an heavy Task, to all ſuch as are unacquainted with it. The very Look or Idea of it is ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to fright and drive them from it. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing therefore had need be done to reconcile and win all Strangers, to the Work. And what can be more proper, than to open and unfold the <hi>bleſſed Comforts</hi> annexed to it, and ſo to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibit Some of thoſe fair <hi>Advantages</hi> which are concomitants of the ſame. <hi>That</hi> therefore I ſhall endeavour to do, tho' I ſpend a <hi>great part</hi> of this Book upon it. Look what Wages is, to the Labourer; or Pay, to the Souldier; or Gain, to the Trader; and the very ſame is the <hi>Bleſſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> of divine <hi>Comforts,</hi> to the holy <hi>Mourner:</hi> a moſt mighty <hi>Inducement,</hi> or cogent <hi>Attractive,</hi> to draw him to the exerciſe of godly Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row.</p>
               <p>Now the <hi>firſt Branch</hi> of <hi>Bleſſedneſs</hi> which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crues to Holy Mourners from their <hi>Preſent</hi> Comforts, grows out of the PROPERTIES of their Comforts. And the <hi>Principal</hi> of thoſe PROPERTIES are theſe <hi>Four.</hi>

               <p>The <hi>firſt</hi> Property of Holy Mourners Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts, which contributes to their <hi>Bleſſedneſs,</hi> is, that they are <hi>Sweet.</hi> And ſo very ſweet are they, that they far ſurpaſs all Bodily Delights. The Church acknowledgeth this Sweetneſs, and makes Proclamation of it, <hi>Cant.</hi> 2.3. <hi>I ſate down under His Shadow, and His Fruit was ſweet to my Taſt.</hi> As the <hi>Shadow</hi> of CHRIST (His Shel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter or Protection) is highly grateful to His Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; ſo His <hi>Fruit</hi> is as ſweet to them. And what is that Fruit, but the <hi>Fruit of the</hi> SPIRIT? one ſort of which is <hi>Joy</hi> (or Comfort) <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.22. A Fruit ſo deliciouſly ſweet, that none can ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel it, ſave that which the Bleſſed Taſt above. As for Pleaſures of <hi>Senſe</hi> they muſt not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare, they are not to be nam'd with it. When <hi>they</hi> riſe higheſt, they are but flat; when they run cleareſt, they are but Dregs; and when we take our fulleſt Injoyment of them, we find Trouble in them, or a Sting after them. The pleaſanteſt Gratifications that we here meet with, are but <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>bitter-ſweets:</hi> and the loftieſt Tranſports of our ſenſual Joys, are either allay'd <hi>with</hi> ſadneſs, or quickly ſink <hi>into</hi> it. One that perfectly knew this, delivers it as plainly; ſpeaking the ſame thing, tho' in different Words: <hi>Even in</hi> Laughter <hi>the Heart is</hi> ſorrowful; <hi>and the</hi> end <hi>of that</hi> mirth <hi>is</hi> heavineſs, <hi>Prov.</hi> 14.13. But divine Comfort is of another ſtrain. That ſhines upon us without dazling our Eyes; lifts
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:34484:38"/> us up on high without turning our Heads; and contains ſuch a true and thorough Sweetneſs in it, as utterly excludes all mixture of Sowrneſs. Well therefore might I ſay, as I juſt now did, and I ſay it again becauſe it is Truth: its Sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is ſuch as ſets it above all <hi>Bodily delights.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So bitter are the Pangs of a troubled Mind, that <hi>Solomon</hi> inſinuates they are unſupportable; <hi>a wounded Spirit who can bear? Prov.</hi> 18.14. But be they never ſo grievous and intolerable, Spiritual Comforts are as delightful. Where they riſe to any heighth in the Soul, or flow into her in any good Plenty; they fill her with ſuch ſolid Pleaſure and Sweetneſs, as never can reſult from external Injoyments. The choiceſt of that ſort of Contentments, in compariſon to theſe, are but ſlight and ſuperficial, but frothy and inſipid things.</p>
               <p>For the ſame Reaſon that holy Sorrows are the heartieſt (as hath been<note n="*" place="margin">Chap. I.</note> noted) holy Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts will, and muſt be the ſweeteſt upon Earth: even becauſe (as they are ſeated in the Soul, ſo) they are raiſed by the, profound and mighty <hi>Workings</hi> of the SPIRIT of GOD. And where He is active in a Soul on purpoſe to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort it, what an Heaven of Sweetneſs muſt <hi>He</hi> produce in it?</p>
               <p>It was the Sweetneſs of theſe Comforts that made St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> cry out in a kind of rapturous Surpriſe, or in a Pang of Admiration, when he felt Himſelf happily incircled with them;<note n="†" place="margin">Neſcio in quam dulcedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem me duces, Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine.</note> O LORD, <hi>I know not into what ſweetneſs Thou wilt lead me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It was the <hi>Sweetneſs</hi> of theſe Comforts that made St. <hi>Jerom</hi> profeſs (with a Solemn Appeal to ALMIGHTY GOD) that he thought
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:34484:39"/> he convers'd with Quires of Angels.<note n="*" place="margin">Teſtor DEUM, poſt Heb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum Jeju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia, viſus ſum mihi inter ipſa agmina Angelorum verſari.</note>

               </p>
               <p>It was the <hi>Sweetneſs</hi> of theſe Comforts that hath ſo fortifi'd and animated ſome pious Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, that in confidence of their Pardon and Salvation, they have Scorn'd and Triumph'd over the Devil and His Angels; and in their Languiſhing Sickneſs, and under near and ſenſible Approaches of Death, have even mockt and derided the Powers of Darkneſs, and challenged and dared them to do their Worſt.</p>
               <p>It was the <hi>Sweetneſs</hi> of theſe Comforts that hath privileg'd ſome with a deſirable <hi>Euthanaſy,</hi> or eaſy Death. And not only with an <hi>eaſy,</hi> but moſt <hi>bleſſed</hi> and <hi>hapyy</hi> one. Exalting their Souls to ſuch Exceſs of Rapture, as their frail Bodies were unable to endure; they have broken in pieces as it were: juſt as we ſee Glaſſes crack and fly, through the Strength of Spirits con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in them.</p>
               <p>Farther yet; ſuch is the <hi>Sweetneſs</hi> of theſe Comforts, that 'tis really <hi>inutterable.</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore St. <hi>Peter</hi> ſays of the Saints of his time, that they <hi>rejoyced</hi>

                  <hi>with Joy</hi> unſpeakable. All the Rhetoric in the World, and all the Orators who uſe that Rhetoric, cannot fully expreſs the delicious Sweetneſs, which holy Comforts derive to good Men. Don't think therefore that I am here going about to <hi>explain</hi> the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Sweetneſs of theſe Comforts, or that I am attempting to give in an exact Account of
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:34484:39"/> it. For when Heaven tells us it is <hi>unſpeakable,</hi> that muſt needs be a Task impoſſible.</p>
               <p>As we noted even now, inſufferable is the torment of a <hi>wounded</hi> Spirit.

                  <hi>Who may ſtand in thy Sight when thou art angry?</hi> or elſe by Devils the Miniſters of His Severity. For whenever GOD gives up ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners to <hi>them</hi> (by withdrawing the care of their Guardian Angels, to whoſe watchful Tutelage or Cuſtody they were committed, or by remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving any other Defence of His Providence whereby they were protected;) they immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately aſſault them with dreadful Violence, and in the Heat of their Malice lay on ſuch furious Strokes upon them, as poor Mortals are not able to ſtand under. As in time of temptation they tickle Mens minds with Thoughts of Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, which wind and draw them to evil In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations not eaſy to be reſiſted, and which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>danger their falling into Deadly ſin: So in time of Deſertion, they Strike mens Conſciences with ſuch diſmal Terrors, as that being unable to ſuſtain the terrible concuſſions, they ſink into horror and raging deſpair. And if the <hi>wrath</hi> of GOD, or of His revengefull Miniſters, can make ſuch direful Impreſſions on our Spirits, as wound them with <hi>Pains</hi> beyond all manner of <hi>Patience;</hi> well may His <hi>comforts</hi> infuſed by His SPIRIT, affect us with <hi>Pleaſures</hi> which for Sweetneſs ſhall exceed all meaſure of <hi>Apprehenſion.</hi> For ſuch Comforts wrought in us by ſuch a Comforter, muſt needs enter deep, enter very
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:34484:40"/> deep into our Souls. They will pierce to the very Root of their Being, and to the center of their Life, and flow in upon them with moſt exquiſite Sweetneſs. With ſuch a Sweetneſs, that as it can come from none but GOD, ſo it will draw us moſt powerfully after Him. And were it not for the Luggage of theſe earthly Bodies which weigh us down; it would not fail, when it is ſtrong upon us, to ſnatch us hence, and carry us up into the glorious Place above. O Bleſſed Creatures they! that are favoured with the injoyment of ſuch ſweet Comforts.</p>
               <p>Yet that ſolemn <hi>Mourners</hi> are ſenſible of them, I dare confidently appeal to themſelves to ſay. When ye have withdrawn from the World, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking you to your Chambers, or entring into your Cloſets; hath not your FATHER who ſeeth in ſecret, viſited you there? Hath He not viſited you with ſweet Conſolations, in the midſt of your cloſeſt mournful Privacies? Yea, hath He not ſo viſited you, as to <hi>fill</hi> your Hearts with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolatory Sweetneſs? And ſo hath He filled you many times as that you have been <hi>overflowed</hi> with it. So overflowed, as that you have <hi>Sunk</hi> in it, as it were, or have been <hi>ſwallowed</hi> up by it. And then forgetting the World, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getting your ſelves; like to Angels in their hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Extaſies, ye have perceived nothing but divine Delights.</p>
               <p>And tho' theſe be <hi>Heighths</hi> to which <hi>all</hi> Mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers do not aſcend, and to which the <hi>ſame</hi> holy Mourners cannot at <hi>all times</hi> attain; yet I doubt not, but their own Experience being witneſs, their Mournings do <hi>commonly</hi> lift them up to very <hi>raiſed</hi> Comforts. Even to ſuch Comforts
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:34484:40"/> as are attended with Sublime and inlivening Sweetneſs, tho' ſome degrees below the higheſt of all. For let me ask; when thou haſt ſpent a Day in religious Mourning, how haſt Thou found thy ſelf after it at night? Haſt thou not felt a grave Lightſomneſs in thy Spirit, and a ſerious Gladneſs in thy Mind, and a moſt plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant Joy lie glowing at thine Heart? And was not the Gratification ariſing from thence, ſuch for Sweetneſs, as no <hi>Worldly</hi> things did ever af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford thee? When thou haſt ſpent ſeveral <hi>Days,</hi> or it may be ſome <hi>Weeks,</hi> in the worthieſt civil Imployments or Recreations; haſt thou met with any thing in them ſo grateful as this? or haſt thou perceived any ſuch ſatisfaction after them? or can any like it be derived from them? But then when the Comforts which here reſt upon Mourners, are ſo incomparably <hi>Sweet;</hi> muſt they not contribute to their being <hi>Bleſſed</hi> in this preſent ſtate?</p>
               <p>In way of Corollary I add but this. When the Chriſtian that is conſtant to his Mourning-days, and accuſtom'd on thoſe days to hear from Heaven in ſweet Illapſes of the Holy Comforter, chances to miſs of his uſual Conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations; this becomes matter of <hi>Trouble</hi> to Him. That Day goes off but heavily, and leaves Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſineſs upon His Spirit; as Comforts on the contrary fill it with <hi>Pleaſantneſs.</hi> And ſo <hi>viſible</hi> are the <hi>Indications</hi> of the injoyment of Comforts on the one ſide; and of the diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment of them on the other; that were I to converſe with ſuch a Man in the cloſe or Evening of ſuch a Day, I durſt almoſt undertake from obſerving his Countenance, and his Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, to tell in ſome meaſure what <hi>ſucceſs</hi> he
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:34484:41"/> hath had. Tho when on ſuch a Day he meets with <hi>no Comforts,</hi> the worſt effect of it is but this: He deſires the more that the <hi>Like</hi> Day may return, and alſo reckons the more upon its coming. As hoping that amends ſhall be made him in the next, for his afflictive Want of ſweet Solace in the Laſt.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Second</hi> beatifying Property of Holy Mourners Comforts is, that they are <hi>Glorious.</hi> So we learn from St. <hi>Peter,</hi> who deſcribing that Spiritual Joy, or Comfort which comes down up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Chriſtians here in the Body; pronounceth it not only to be unſpeakable, but <hi>full of Glory,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.8. And by ſo big a Word, ſome very <hi>great thing</hi> muſt certainly be meant. The leaſt it can import, is aſſuredly thus much: That the Joy, or Comfort wherein Chriſtians are happy here below, is of a moſt <hi>exalted</hi> and <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined</hi> Nature. As it is <hi>ſweet,</hi> without all mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of <hi>Bitterneſs;</hi> ſo it is <hi>noble,</hi> without any al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loy of <hi>Baſeneſs.</hi> It is no way mean nor ſordid in the leaſt: not at all like <hi>Bodily</hi> Pleaſure, which is apt to corrupt and ſink the Mind, and ſo tends to Degeneracy, and conſequently to Diſhonour; but is moſt defecate, pure, and ſublime. And as it is generous and lofty in <hi>it ſelf,</hi> ſo it contains a Sublimating Force in it, and a Power ſufficient to inable <hi>us.</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore where-ever it enters and dwells, it fails not to raiſe and brighten the Soul. It beautifies and dignifies our Spirits at once, and adds more <hi>Luſtre</hi> to them, as well as more <hi>Life.</hi> And ſo indeed it may properly be ſtil'd Joy <hi>full of Glory;</hi> as being very near a-kin to that glorious Joy in the immortal State.</p>
               <pb n="69" facs="tcp:34484:41"/>
               <p>That <hi>this</hi> World hath its <hi>Joys</hi> (ſuch as they are) cannot be denied. And tho' conſidering their extreme Shallowneſs and Emptineſs, we are ready to think too highly of them, and to beſtow too fair Epithets upon them; yet I do not know that the choiceſt of them all, were ever called <hi>glorious</hi> Joys. Nor is there any Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon for it. But that's the high Title of the Chriſtians Joy, even of His Joy here upon <hi>Earth,</hi> and given to it by the HOLY GHOST Himſelf. And He being infallible in what He ſpeaks, in the denomination there can be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of Strain beyond real Truth.</p>
               <p>In the 45th <hi>Pſalm,</hi> the <hi>King's Daughter,</hi> or the Church, is proclaimed <hi>all glorious within.</hi> So that how defective ſoever True Chriſtians may be as to <hi>outward</hi> Imbelliſhments; yet they ſhine with <hi>inward</hi> Splendors and Excellencies; <hi>Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,</hi> and <hi>Comforts.</hi> Their <hi>Graces</hi> are ſo bright, that they glitter like the dazling <hi>Glory</hi> above; and therefore are called by that Name. <hi>We are changed from</hi> Glory <hi>to</hi> Glory, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.18; meaning from <hi>Grace</hi> upon Earth, to <hi>Glory</hi> in Heaven. And then their <hi>Comforts</hi> muſt be <hi>glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious</hi> as well as their <hi>Graces;</hi> elſe St. <hi>Peter</hi> would never have expreſs'd them by the Character of<note n="*" place="margin">

                  <hi>glorified Joy.</hi> And truly in their Graces and Comforts <hi>both,</hi> Saints are ſo very glorious here, and ſo near to the Glories which ſhall be here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after; that nothing but <hi>thoſe</hi> Glories can exceed <hi>theſe.</hi>

               <p>And that Holy <hi>Mourners</hi> ſhall have their ſhare in theſe <hi>glorious</hi> Comforts, we need not queſtion in the Leaſt. For where the Apoſtle averrs that Chriſtians rejoiced with <hi>Joy full of Glory;</hi> it is ſpoken of thoſe<note n="‖" place="margin">

               <p>The <hi>third</hi> beatifying Property of Holy Mourners Comforts is, that they are <hi>ſtrong.</hi> So they are denomiated, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.18. <hi>ſtrong Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolations.</hi> And ſuch they were ſignified to be long ſince, <hi>Neh.</hi> 8.10. For there the Joy of the LORD is ſaid to be His <hi>People's</hi> Strength. And
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:34484:42"/> here lies the great Difference betwixt Comforts ſpiritual and divine; and thoſe which ariſe from outward Accommodations, and bodily Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factions. For the <hi>latter</hi> at beſt are but faint, and weak, and languid things; whereas the <hi>former</hi> are moſt lively and powerful. So lively as to revive our Hearts, and ſo powerful as to ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then our Hands to the more ready and laudable performance of our Duties. But in what in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances they will thus inliven, and enable us; need not here be ſhewn, becauſe in ſome of the Chapters enſuing, it will ſufficiently ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear.</p>
               <p>The <hi>fourth</hi> beatifying Property of Holy Mourners Comforts is, that they are <hi>Secure.</hi> So well ſecured to faithful Chriſtians, that they are like to abide <hi>for ever</hi> with them. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they are called <hi>everlaſting Conſolations,</hi> 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2.16. And let none that are ſincerely and throughly Religious, doubt at all of their ſharing in them; they being a moſt <hi>free Gift,</hi> of as free a Love; as is there hinted to the <hi>Theſſalonic</hi> Church. <hi>Our</hi> LORD JESUS CHRIST <hi>Himſelf, and</hi> GOD <hi>even our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, hath loved us, and</hi> given <hi>us</hi> everlaſting Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation. So that let us but maintain our Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Sincerity, and we need not fear being diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſeſs'd of our Spiritual Comforts. However they may riſe and fall; and go and return; and intermit at times, and alter in meaſures, as they often do, and always did: yet they ſhall not be totally, they ſhall not be finally cut off or quenched. If the ſame GOD who gives them, pleaſes to continue them, nothing can be able to deprive us of them. So much is intimated by our deareſt LORD, St. <hi>John</hi>
                  <pb n="72" facs="tcp:34484:43"/> 14.27. Peace <hi>I leave with you,</hi> my <hi>Peace I give unto you; not as the World giveth, give I unto you.</hi> Betwixt the Peace which CHRIST gives, and the Peace which the <hi>World</hi> gives, there is vaſt Difference. As much as there is betwixt that which is ſubſtantial and heavenly; and that which is Secular and void of Solidity. And as great difference there is betwixt their <hi>Ways</hi> of giving it. When the <hi>World</hi> gives Peace, it does it <hi>formally,</hi> in way of Empty heartleſs Wiſh: when CHRIST gives it, He does it <hi>effectually,</hi> in way of actual cordial Diſpenſation. And how unſettled and Tranſient ſoever the <hi>World</hi>'s Peace may be, CHRIST's is always moſt durable and permanent. When once He gives it to us, He never finally retracts, or takes it from us again till we force him to it. He would fain have us keep it, and keep it for ever. And in caſe we do not, the whole Fault is our own, becauſe we wilfully forfeit it, or chooſe to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go it. Let but us be careful to preſerve it, and none but GOD can take it from us. And how unlikely is it that <hi>He</hi> ſhould bereave us of it, when it was a kind and pretious <hi>Legacy</hi> we ſee, left us by our dying REDEEMER? Nor would <hi>He</hi> ever have bequeath'd it to us, if He had not known it was His FATHER's Will it ſhould reſt upon us. And when this <hi>Peace,</hi> or <hi>Comfort</hi> is our SAVIOUR's <hi>Dona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive;</hi> and when it is the FATHER's Pleaſure, that what the SON beſtowed on us ſhould abide with us; who can pretend to Power enough to take it away? Does it not come down from Heaven? and who then can reach ſo high as to ſtop its deſcent? Does it not ſpring up in our very Souls? and who then can reach
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:34484:43"/> ſo deep as to pluck it thence? In ſhort; as none but GOD in Heaven can give us it, ſo none upon Earth can take it from us. Our kind LORD hath not only intimated, but openly and aloud declar'd as much; and none amongſt us ſhould be ſo incredulous, as not to take His Word in the Caſe: <hi>Your</hi> Heart <hi>ſhall</hi> Rejoyce, <hi>and your</hi> Joy <hi>no man</hi> taketh from you, S. <hi>Joh.</hi> 16.22. So that Chriſtians Joys are Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dial things, they reach their <hi>Hearts:</hi> and not only ſo, but they take up their <hi>Reſidence</hi> there, and <hi>none</hi> ſhall ever raviſh them thence, unleſs themſelves be firſt willing to let them go. Even thoſe cruel Hands which could take away their Eſtates, their Liberties, their Friends, and their very Limbs; could not take their <hi>Joys</hi> or <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts</hi> from them. So far from that, that <hi>by</hi> ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king away <hi>thoſe,</hi> they did but ſecure, if not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe <hi>theſe.</hi> For it is ſaid, that <hi>they took</hi> Joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully <hi>the ſpoiling of their Goods, Heb.</hi> 10.34. When they were Mercileſsly ſtript of <hi>other</hi> good things, yet their <hi>Comforts</hi> being left, they could rejoice in <hi>them:</hi> yea, rejoice in the <hi>ſad loſſes</hi> which they Suffered, by <hi>virtue</hi> of thoſe Comforts they ſtill retained. And when Comforts ſtick by them in ſuch tragical Circumſtances, this ſufficiently proves that they are <hi>Secure.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And then that theſe ſtrong and ſecure Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts belong moſt <hi>properly</hi> to Holy <hi>Mourners;</hi> is eaſily made out. For in that very place where the LORD JESUS tells His Proſelytes, that their Joy ſhall not be taken from them; He tells them withal, that they <hi>ſhall be ſorrowful, but their Sorrow ſhall be</hi> turned <hi>into Joy,</hi> S. <hi>Joh.</hi> 16.20. Whence it appears, that this Strong Comfort, this Secure or durable Comfort, is partly to
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:34484:44"/> ſpring out of <hi>Holy Sorrow;</hi> and ſo Pious <hi>Mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers</hi> have the cleareſt and moſt indefeſible Title to it.</p>
               <p>Thus we have run through the <hi>four</hi> Chief <hi>Properties</hi> of Spiritual Comforts, which contain the <hi>firſt Branch</hi> of <hi>Bleſſedneſs</hi> that thoſe Comforts afford to Holy <hi>Mourners.</hi> They are divinely <hi>Sweet,</hi> ſo Sweet as to be <hi>inexplicable.</hi> They are divinely <hi>Glorious,</hi> ſo Glorious as to be <hi>incompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable.</hi> And at the ſame time they are <hi>Strong,</hi> ſo Strong as to be very <hi>ſerviceable</hi> to us. And with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al they are <hi>Secure,</hi> ſo Secure as that none in this World can <hi>take</hi> them <hi>from</hi> us. Whence it will follow, that as many as partake of theſe Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Comforts, muſt be <hi>Bleſſed Creatures.</hi> And ſo Holy <hi>Mourners</hi> muſt be Bleſſed upon <hi>Earth,</hi> becauſe their Mourning (as we have prov'd) gives them a Right to theſe Beatifying Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts; and regularly will put them into Poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of them.</p>
               <p>But then what a <hi>Motive,</hi> what a powerful Motive to Holy Mourning muſt this be? Can we aim at more than being <hi>bleſſed</hi> upon Earth? Can we deſire more Bleſſedneſs than divine <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts</hi> will bring us? Are not they Delights which come from GOD? Are not they Joys which deſcend from Heaven? And ſo muſt they not fill us with <hi>bleſſed Pleaſures?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And this alone granted, that divine Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts fluſh holy Mourners with bleſſed Pleaſures (which truly in Reaſon cannot be denied:) how powerfully, I ſay, muſt it <hi>draw</hi> us to <hi>mourn?</hi> For Pleaſures of all things are moſt alluring to Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind; nor can they be otherwiſe, conſidering our Nature. For I plainly averr, and (were there place for it here) I could eaſily prove, that
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:34484:44"/> Man was a Creature made very much for Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures. The Goodneſs of His Creator, the Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of His Being, the State wherein he was at firſt put, and the End to which He was deſign'd at laſt; all ſhew as much. And tho' now by means of His Folly and Sin, his Nature be corrupted, and his Circumſtances altered, and Himſelf expoſed to innumerable Miſeries; yet this does not argue but that he might <hi>originally</hi> be created for Pleaſures; as thoſe Angels were, who are now in Chains, and deſtin'd to Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. And truly if Men were not <hi>made</hi> for Pleaſures, whence come thoſe violent Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to them, and thoſe vehement and furious Deſires after them, which are ſo raging and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruly in their Breaſts? And when it is really thus with them; when Pleaſures were a great End of their Creation, and they muſt neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily enjoy them, becauſe they inſatiably deſire them; is it not fit that they ſhould chooſe the <hi>beſt?</hi> Will it not be wiſe in them to ſingle out thoſe Pleaſures which will make them <hi>bleſſed?</hi> Yet if they would do that, they muſt be ſure to make choice of <hi>divine Comforts.</hi> And to procure them, they cannot do better than to fall to Holy <hi>Mourning;</hi> which certainly leads them to the Fruition of them. So we have done with the <hi>firſt Branch</hi> of Bleſſedneſs ſpringing up to Holy Mourners from the Root of their Comforts. From the Root of their preſent Spiritual Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts, as they contain the aforeſaid Properties.</p>

               <p>THE Matter of this Chapter relates to the Subſtance of the former, and runs upon an <hi>Inference</hi> drawn from the Same. In it, I confeſs, we digreſs a little. But tho' what it delivers be ſomewhat beſide our profeſſed Scope, yet the Benefit, I hope, will make amends for the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viation: it being a kind of <hi>Apology</hi> for the <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Religion,</hi> or a ſhort <hi>Vindication</hi> of it from the contemptuous <hi>Obloquy</hi> of Evil Men. The <hi>Inference</hi> is this.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>How egregious is the Folly and Raſhneſs of thoſe, who decry Religion as</hi> vain <hi>and</hi> unprofitable! So degenerate are ſome, and ſo far ſunk below the Raiſed Dignity of their Reaſonable Nature; that they mock and cavil at true Religion, as if it were an empty and fruitleſs thing, and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with no conſiderable Advantage.<note n="*" place="margin">Job 21.15.</note> 
                  <hi>What is the</hi> ALMIGHTY <hi>that we ſhould ſerve Him? and what Profit ſhould we have if we ſhould Pray unto Him?</hi> was the Language of the Diſſolute in <hi>Job</hi>'s Days.<note n="†" place="margin">Mal. 3.14.</note> 
                  <hi>It is vain to ſerve</hi> GOD, <hi>and what</hi> Profit <hi>is it that we have kept His Ordinances?</hi> ſaid ſome Impious and Blaſphemous <hi>Jews</hi> in the Prophet <hi>Malachy</hi>'s Time. And Men of ſuch vile and ungodly Principles ſeem to be ſprung up in too great Plenty amongſt <hi>us.</hi> For how <hi>many</hi> are there, that diſpute, or deny all Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:34484:45"/> of Righteouſneſs? And as for ſuch as in Faith and Hope of the ſame, addict themſelves to Virtuous and Holy Living; they ſlight and deſpiſe them, and vilify and reproach them: eſpecially if they be a little ſtricter than ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary, and their Zeal flies above the Common Pitch. Then they cenſure and condemn them for downright Ideots; for People of no Senſe, of no Reaſon, and of no Judgment; that dote upon Shadows, and feed upon Fancies, and fill their Expectations with impoſſible things. But let ſuch know, that <hi>themſelves</hi> are miſtaken and grievouſly miſled; and as for the Sons of Virtue and Goodneſs (whom they are pleas'd thus to Scorn and Deride) they are the wiſeſt and happieſt of all Mortals. For as upon ſureſt Grounds they look for infinite <hi>future</hi> Retributi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; ſo they are ſenſible of <hi>preſent</hi> Recompence.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> ſpeaks of this, where he ſays <hi>in keeping</hi> GOD's <hi>Commandments there is</hi> great Reward, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 19.11. Not there <hi>ſhall</hi> be Reward for keeping them, <hi>hereafter</hi> in Heaven; but there <hi>is</hi> Reward in keeping them <hi>here</hi> upon Earth.

                  <hi>a great Emolument,</hi> or Recompence. And what the Sacred Writer thus poſitively aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerts, the faithful Chriſtain <hi>feels</hi> true in himſelf. He does not only <hi>hope</hi> for Remuneration to come, but He actually <hi>finds</hi> it in his preſent En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment. And as it is <hi>great</hi> in many Reſpects, ſo a great part of it lies in thoſe excellent <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts,</hi> which deſcending from above, do ſtrange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly delight Him. And that this Reward muſt conſiſt of theſe <hi>Comforts,</hi> is clear from hence; becauſe otherwiſe no <hi>great Reward</hi> can <hi>here</hi> come to Men in keeping GOD's Commands.
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:34484:46"/> Yea, inſtead of <hi>great</hi> Reward, or of <hi>any</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, their very keeping of His Precepts, may expoſe them (as it hath done Martyrs) to the worſt Sufferings and Deaths. And for any to ſay that GOD makes <hi>Temporal</hi> or <hi>Worldly</hi> Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings a <hi>great Reward</hi> to ſuch as keep His Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments; would be perfect <hi>Non-ſenſe.</hi> For the <hi>greateſt</hi> of <hi>thoſe</hi> are not only really <hi>little</hi> in <hi>themſelves;</hi> but <hi>much leſs</hi> ſtill in the <hi>Eſteem</hi> of good Chriſtians. So that 'tis neceſſary that the great Reward mention'd by the <hi>Pſalmiſt,</hi> ſhould be made up of <hi>Joys</hi> or <hi>Comforts</hi> from Heaven: And truly were the worſt but well acquainted with it, by being made throughly ſenſible of it; they could never ſtick at <hi>owning</hi> it to be <hi>great.</hi> And from the <hi>ſenſe</hi> of its <hi>greatneſs</hi> they would immediately alter their opinion of <hi>Chriſtianity;</hi> and no longer blame its moſt zealous Profeſſors for taking much pains (as they now think they do) in purſuing <hi>nothing.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Indeed ſo long as Men chooſe to reſt in <hi>Sin,</hi> and are unwilling Captives to domineering Luſts, and the baſe and ſinful Pleaſures of the Body; 'tis impoſſible they ſhould enjoy the Comforts of the SPIRIT. I am confident rather (let them ſay what they will, and make what fair ſhew they can) that they moſtly lie as it were, upon a painful Rack. There hain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Guilt (unleſs they be ſtupid, or quite inſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſate) will certainly be attended with ſecret Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and will raiſe ſuch fears and horrors within, as they ſhall no way be able to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs. There may as well be Reſt in the Sea when 'tis toſſed with Winds, as true Peace to that Soul which periſheth in Sin. For <hi>the Wicked are like the troubled Sea when it cannot Reſt;</hi>
                  <pb n="79" facs="tcp:34484:46"/> and to them <hi>there is no Peace ſaith</hi> GOD, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 57.20, 21. But let them abandon Vice, and betake them to Virtuous and Religious Courſes, and they ſhall ſoon perceive an happy Change. Then the mouth of Conſcience ſhall quickly be ſtopped, and her hideous Clamours ſhall all be quieted, and the bloodly Scourge wherewith ſhe chaſtiſeth them, ſhall be wound up and laid aſide; and inward Peace, and Applauſe of Mind, ſhall exceedingly refreſh them. Then they ſhall be viſited with Joys from on high and the Light of GOD's Countenance ſhall ſhine into their Hearts, and the Beams of His Favour ſhall di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late their Spirits, and the Influence of Heaven ſhall ſweetly repleniſh their expanded Souls. In a word, then the great JEHOVAH will love them, and delight in them, and lifting them up into Communion with Himſelf, will raviſh them with high and ſtrong Conſolations. With ſuch Conſolations as can proceed from nothing but His propitious Preſence, and the favourable Illapſes of that divine Paraclete, who is the Comforter of GOD's Elect.</p>
               <p>Let none doubt of the <hi>Truth</hi> of this. Let none queſtion but there <hi>are</hi> ſuch excellent Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts as theſe. If your own Experience hath not diſcover'd them, yet do but perform your re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective Duties, in anſwer to the ſeveral Obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons upon you; and that will lead you directly to them. Then you ſhall ſoon find that extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Sweetneſs is treaſur'd up for the Righteous. A Sweetneſs ſurpaſſing our corporal Delights, and the fulleſt Gratifications of all lower Appetites. And well it may, as being indeed no other than Angelic Satisfactions, which from the Face of GOD, are ſhed down into the Hearts of pious Men.</p>

               <p>Some refined <hi>Heathens</hi> priz'd Tranquility of Mind at ſuch a Rate, that they accounted it no leſs than the <hi>chiefeſt good.</hi> Thus <hi>Epicurus</hi> taught, that Happineſs conſiſts in <hi>Pleaſure.</hi> Meaning that Pleaſure which ſprings up and ſpreads through <hi>Virtuous</hi> Livers; and is the pure Reſult of that Harmony and Agreement, which there is betwixt Virtue, and the rational part of them that practiſe it. Tho' ſome miſtaking him, have thought he plac'd it in groſs Delights; and ſo have condemn'd Him for a notorious Senſualiſt, and a Patron of vile and ſhameful Voluptuouſneſs. And as this was<note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Note</hi> IV.</note> 
                  <hi>Epicurus</hi>'s Opinion, ſo it was the Judgment of many other great and noble Philoſophers.</p>
               <p>Now when there were ſome <hi>Ethnic</hi> Sages, who thought ſo highly of inward Peace, or mental Pleaſure, which moral Integrity brought along with it; how unreaſonable is it, that <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity</hi> ſhould be condemn'd as vain and empty, when plenty of Spiritual <hi>Conſolations</hi> attend it? Eſpecially if we conſider, how <hi>much</hi> the Sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Heathen <hi>Tranquility,</hi> muſt be <hi>inferior</hi> to that of the Chriſtian <hi>Comforts.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I wiſh therefore, and I pray, that all ſupine and careleſs Livers would bethink themſelves, and amend their ways. That they would all relinquiſh their Follies, and Impieties, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vote themſelves to the Love and Obedience of CHRIST. <hi>That</hi> would introduce them into His Favour; and then nothing ſhould be thought too dear for them. Then they ſhould find, that He would embrace them in His Arms, and lay them in His Boſom, and careſs and enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain them with frequent Intercourſes, and aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing Kindneſs. That he would feaſt them
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:34484:47"/> with reiterated Foretaſts of Heaven, till He tranſlates them hence, and takes them up thither. Where, after delicious Prelibations here, they ſhall drink their <hi>fill</hi> of Divine Delights, being ſwallowed up of eternal Pleaſures, and an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſe Abyſs of compleat Felicity. Thus ſhall it be with all thoſe that are adopted into our LORD JESUS's Family, and give up them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to ſerve Him with zealous Sincerity. But if any will rather be Drudges to Sin, and Vaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſals to Satan, and ſpend their Time in Vanity and Licentiouſneſs; be it known to ſuch, that they do but forſake their own Happineſs. They do not only loſe a Crown, and loſe a Kingdom in the <hi>everlaſting</hi> State; but forfeit far greater Felicities in <hi>this,</hi> than any that thoſe ſhort de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſive Satisfactions, which they fooliſhly dote on to their Souls Deſtruction, can poſſibly bring in unto them.</p>
               <p>In caſe the Looſe and Vicious Object, that they have little <hi>Reaſon</hi> to <hi>believe</hi> this, that Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion hath ſuch Happineſs entailed upon it; and that ſuch <hi>preſent</hi> remunerative Comforts as theſe, are <hi>annext</hi> to Chriſtianity; for they <hi>know nothing</hi> of them, and <hi>never enjoyed</hi> them: it may be anſwered; No, wonder that <hi>they</hi> ſhould be Strangers to Comforts, when they take no meet courſe to be acquainted with them. <hi>The work of Righteouſneſs ſhall be Peace, Iſai.</hi> 32.17. And therefore they that poſt on in the ways of ſin, muſt needs be deſtitute of divine Comforts, as running moſt directly and unhappily from them. But then their <hi>miſſing</hi> them does only ſhew they are <hi>unworthy</hi> of them; but argues not at all that there <hi>are</hi> no ſuch things, for the <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> of which we have ſo very good Evidence.
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:34484:48"/> For as when our LORD JESUS left this World, and His diſciples in it, He <hi>promiſed</hi> to give them <hi>another Comforter;</hi> So we very well know, that He <hi>fulfilled</hi> His Promiſe. And as a ſignal effect of its bleſſed Accompliſhment, we find <hi>all the Churches walking in the Comfort of the</hi> HOLY GHOST, <hi>Act.</hi> 9.31. And that Comfort was ſo far from being a <hi>peculiar</hi> Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit, or Bleſſing <hi>appropriate</hi> to thoſe <hi>firſt</hi> Churches; that it is a common and ſtanding Privilege, ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally ſettled upon the faithful Members of the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Community. This may be ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered from what occurs, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.17. <hi>The Kingdom of</hi> GOD <hi>is Righteouſneſs, and Peace, and Joy in the</hi> Holy GHOST. So that as many as are true Subjects to the Kingdom of the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> which (as it is an Image or Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpart of that Archetypal Kingdom above) is called the <hi>Kingdom</hi> of GOD: ſhall as certainly have <hi>Joy</hi> reſting upon them, as they muſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily have <hi>Righteouſneſs</hi> dwelling in them. The one is not more eſſential to their Religion, than the other (at times) is an inſeparable <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> of the ſame. And therefore to ſay that true Religion is <hi>without Reward,</hi> is as much as to ſay, that the Word of GOD is void of Truth, or that the HOLY GHOST is guilty of Falſhood. For when he declares that Holy Joy ſhall be to the Religious; as we may be ſure He will impart it: ſo as ſure we may be, that when he miniſters it to any, He does it to <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> their paſt Diligence, as well as to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage their Perſeverance for the future.</p>
               <p>And as many as ſhare largely in this Joy, or Comfort, and in the heavenly Delights which reſult from them; muſt not only take
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:34484:48"/> them for a <hi>Reward</hi> of GOD's ſending, but with the <hi>Pſalmiſt,</hi> muſt call them (what all that feel them will ever count them) a <hi>great</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward. And they have Reaſon to do ſo. For I cannot but ſay it, (as knowing it to be true) and O that the whole World might hear and believe it! The Sons of divine and holy Conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, are <hi>far</hi> the <hi>happieſt</hi> of <hi>all</hi> upon Earth. They are the only <hi>men of Pleaſures</hi> here. The <hi>trueſt Epicures</hi> that ever lived. And they muſt <hi>needs</hi> be ſo. For beſides, that they have <hi>Senſes</hi> like other People,<note place="margin">I ſpeak this to let the Men of the World know, that true Chriſtians, in Pleaſures of <hi>Senſe,</hi> have the advantage of them.</note> and ſo can enjoy even <hi>all kind of Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures</hi> as well as they; and beſides, that they <hi>double</hi> theſe Pleaſures to themſelves, while they take only the <hi>Top</hi> or <hi>Flower</hi> of them, by taſting them in none but <hi>lawful</hi> Inſtances; and beſides that they <hi>whet</hi> and <hi>quicken</hi> their Appetites, while by <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraining</hi> and well <hi>governing</hi> them, they keep them <hi>freſh,</hi> and <hi>keen,</hi> and always upon the <hi>Wing,</hi> which makes them to reliſh ordinary Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures with a more lively Guſt, and finer Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy: they are ſenſible alſo of this <hi>high ſort</hi> of Pleaſures which we are upon; Even of thoſe Pleaſures which are cauſed by theſe <hi>Comforts</hi> that deſcend from GOD. And <hi>they</hi> moſt aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuredly muſt be <hi>peerleſs.</hi> For being more noble and pure, they muſt be more congruous and ſuitable, and ſo more gratifying and delectable than any other. And no marvel they ſhould, when they come down from Heaven, and are a part of it; when they tend to Heaven, and help us up to it; and when they place us <hi>in</hi> Heaven almoſt, even while we are <hi>out</hi> of it. And to ſpeak the truth, there is no ſincere Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:34484:49"/> in the World, but muſt be ſenſible of <hi>ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what</hi> of this Reward; becauſe, in a lower de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, it is mingled with his <hi>Religion,</hi> and inclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in its very <hi>Duties.</hi> Thus what Eaſe, what Peace, what Pleaſure is contained in Humility and Meekneſs, in Chaſtity and Contentedneſs, and in the like divine Virtues; over what attends the contrary Vices, or the Practiſts of them? And if we look to the <hi>Love</hi> of the true GOD, which is at once both our chief religious <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,</hi> and <hi>Performance;</hi> O how ſweet and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſhing is it! When at any time He is pleas'd to ſhed it down upon us, what an Heaven ſprings up from its refreſhing Gleams? And when <hi>our</hi> Love kindled by <hi>His,</hi> aſcends to Him in reciprocal Flames; what ſprightly Joys are mingled with its Fervours? The pure Actings of our Love to GOD, excite and cauſe ſuch vital Pleaſures, that the Fire can never be more full of Heat, than they are of ſtrong and tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting Delights. We know, O LORD, and we believe none like them; and therefore we deſire even none beſides them, or none at leaſt in compariſon of them. But how can Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity be <hi>rewardleſs</hi> then, when by its <hi>innate</hi> Sweetneſs it is thus <hi>Self-recompens'd?</hi> And when theſe its <hi>natural,</hi> in-bred Satisfactions are raiſed and ſtrengthen'd by thoſe <hi>adventitious</hi> ones which the HOLY GHOST derives unto us; its Reward muſt needs be exceeding great.</p>
               <p>I confeſs indeed (which does not diminiſh, but rather greaten the <hi>Reward</hi> we ſpeak of) that to ſet forth theſe Comforts in their genuine Sweetneſs, is not poſſible. As hath been ſaid already (more than once) there is no expreſſing them to the heighth. All that hath been ſpoken
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:34484:49"/> by <hi>me,</hi> and all that can be ſpoken by <hi>others;</hi> will amount at beſt, but to a dark and dim, to an imperfect and injurious repreſentation of them. Yet to <hi>ſpeak</hi> of theſe Comforts, and the Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of them, being very delightful, as well as to enjoy them; forgive me if I add what fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows concerning them. They are the Wealth of the Poor, and the Happineſs of the Rich; the Light of the Blind, and the Muſic of the Deaf; the Glory of the Obſcure, and the Crown of the Honourable; The Solace of the Young, and the Support of the Old; the Strength of the Weak, and the Cordial of the Sick, and the Joy of all pure and ſanctifi'd Minds. And beſides, that they fill us with Solid <hi>Joys,</hi> they enrich us with many Subſtantial <hi>Benefits.</hi> They elevate our Thoughts, and they open our Eyes, and they help us to diſcover the Dignity of our Nature, by our very capacity of enjoying ſuch delights. They convince us there is a GOD by an Argument from inward Senſe, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate His Exiſtence by His affecting In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence; as the Sun is prov'd to ſhine, by his chearing Beams. They do not only aſſure us that there is a DEITY, but they induce us to love Him; and they entice us to obey Him; and they make the Duties we owe Him, to be as eaſy and pleaſant, as they are uſeful and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent. At the ſame time, and by the ſame Strengths that they enable us to ſerve and <hi>ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour</hi> GOD; they impower us effectually to <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt</hi> the Devil, to <hi>deſpiſe</hi> the World, to <hi>crucify</hi> the Fleſh, and to <hi>deny,</hi> our ſelves. And as they help us to <hi>eſchew</hi> Moral <hi>Evils</hi> with Dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence; ſo likewiſe to endure <hi>afflictive</hi> ones with Patience. And from hating and declining all
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:34484:50"/> Evil things, they carry us on to the practice of every thing that is Good. And ſo by aſſiſting us to <hi>live</hi> righteouſly in the World, they diſpoſe and fit us to <hi>dye</hi> piouſly and chearfully. Theſe are a <hi>few</hi> of thoſe <hi>many</hi> Advantages which Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts from Heaven, and the pleaſures of them, derive unto us. But he that undertakes to recite them <hi>all,</hi> may task himſelf in the next place, to tell over the Stars, or to ſum up the Sands on the Sea-ſhore, or to count the number of thoſe buſie Atoms which dance unweariedly in the Sun-ſhine. They are too numerous for Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation. But then <hi>that</hi> Religion which is fraught with <hi>ſuch Comforts,</hi> as lead to <hi>ſuch Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures,</hi> and conduce to <hi>ſuch Benefits;</hi> can never be empty of competent <hi>Rewards.</hi> And yet theſe Benefits, Pleaſures, and Comforts, do all abound to the unfeigned and active Profeſſors of <hi>Chriſtianity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Were there any thing in the entire Body of it; any one thing in all the Whole Syſteme of its various Duties, <hi>Inconſiſtent</hi> with theſe its re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munerative <hi>Comforts;</hi> in likelihood it ſhould be <hi>Mourning,</hi> as being (one would think) moſt oppoſite to <hi>Joy.</hi> Yet <hi>Holy Mourning</hi> is ſo far from being inconſiſtent <hi>with,</hi> or deſtructive <hi>to</hi> the Chriſtians <hi>Comforts,</hi> that it never damps them in the leaſt: ſo far from damping them, that (as we have ſhewed) it is Fuel for them, and helps to kindle and inflame them.</p>
               <p>For any to talk therefore that the Chriſtian Religion (which is ſo marvelouſly encourag'd at <hi>preſent,</hi> and even by <hi>Mourning</hi>) is a vain, and empty, and <hi>rewardleſs</hi> thing; it but to ſlander <hi>that,</hi> and diſparage <hi>themſelves.</hi> And as many amongſt us as are ſo unadviſed, I heartily wiſh
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:34484:50"/> happier in a better Experience; which may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctify their Miſtake, and capacitate them to give a truer Judgment in the caſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Two Words</hi> more ſhall now cloſe up this Chapter. The one I direct to <hi>looſe</hi> and <hi>careleſs</hi> Chriſtians; the other to ſuch as are <hi>ſtrict and circumſpect.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To the <hi>Careleſs</hi> and <hi>Diſſolute</hi> I have <hi>this</hi> to ſay. <hi>Be not enemies to your ſelves.</hi> 'Tis too too much to be Enemies to GOD: be not Enemies to your own Happineſs alſo. Yet ſuch you are, and muſt be, ſo long as you are cold and care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs in Religion. For ſo long you exclude your ſelves from that Felicity which is prepar'd for the Zealous, and promiſed to them. <hi>That I may ſee the felicity of thy choſen, and rejoyce in the Gladneſs of thy People:</hi> So we read <hi>Pſal.</hi> 106.5. Whence it is manifeſt, that GOD's choſen People have a <hi>peculiar Felicity</hi> belonging to them; and that this Felicity conſiſts in <hi>Joy</hi> and <hi>Glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</hi> Why then do you barr your ſelves from the fruition of it? What makes you ſo indiſcreet as to ſlight or overlook ſo valuable a Privilege? Alas, without any long Inquiry, we may eaſily find out the Reaſon of the Folly: and it is <hi>this.</hi> You are ſo taken with <hi>low</hi> and <hi>ſenſual</hi> Pleaſures, that you have no concern for thoſe that are <hi>ſpiritual.</hi> So intent upon mean and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Delights, that your Minds are drawn off from ſuch as are divine. O unwiſe and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſterous courſe! Men are Lovers of Pleaſures more than Lovers of GOD: when the Love of GOD (which is the Top of Religion) contains the trueſt and the ſweeteſt Pleaſures. Yea, the <hi>only</hi> Pleaſures which are fit for their Souls, and adequate to them; and ſo alone
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:34484:51"/> able to render them <hi>bleſſed,</hi> now and for ever. Is it poſſible that Creatures indu'd with Reaſon ſhould be ſo inconſiderate? That they ſhould throw away the Kernel, to keep the Shell: and preferr the Shadow, before the Subſtance. Strange to think! yet thus it is. Even the dimmeſt Eye which ſees any thing, may diſcern this; that looſe Religioniſts are devoted to Pleaſures. Yea, without diſſembling, or mincing the matter, they are too eagerly bent and ſet upon them. Touching <hi>many</hi> of them it is obvious enough to every ones Notice, that their Thoughts and their Studies, their Wits and their Arts, their Cares and their Pains are imployed chiefly for their Pleaſures. For Inventing, that is, or for Procuring them; or elſe for Preſerving, or Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moting of them. Their, Time they waſte in following them, their Strengths in injoying them, and count nothing too much for conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuing and inhancing them. When they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject and labour to increaſe their Wealth, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large their Knowledge, to advance their Power, Honour, or the like; what do they aim at in the ultimate Scope of their Intentions, but to heighten their Pleaſures? For were they <hi>pleaſed</hi> as highly with the Things that they <hi>have,</hi> or with the Circumſtances they are <hi>in;</hi> why ſhould they deſire, or why ſhould they endeavour to <hi>alter</hi> either? But <hi>Pleaſures</hi> they <hi>muſt have</hi> at any Rate, and to their Pleaſures they <hi>will add</hi> what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it coſts them. And which is very deplo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, not only their Time, their Eſtates, and their Strength; but their Healths and their Lives, and their deareſt <hi>Souls,</hi> are often times made the Price to purchaſe them. O moſt ſad conſideration this! thoſe very Pleaſures, which
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:34484:51"/> they violently love, and eagerly deſire, and painfully purſue, and exceſſively pay for; are not only <hi>falſe,</hi> but <hi>deſtructive</hi> Ones to them, and the <hi>Reverſe</hi> of thoſe which ſhould make them Happy. However they may pleaſe them, they moſt miſerably cheat them; and inſtead of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributing to their Benefit, tend to their Ruine (and unleſs they grow wiſer) will terminate in it. In reference to theſe Men therefore I cannot but reſume, I cannot but inforce the <hi>Caution</hi> I have taken up. Be not Enemies, O be not Enemies to your own Happineſs. If for en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joying Pleaſures you be in good earneſt; and your vehement Deſires of them cannot be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troll'd: make choice of the <hi>beſt,</hi> and take up with none but the moſt <hi>beatifying.</hi> And that ye may lay ſure hold of theſe, be <hi>truly Religious.</hi> Study the Will, and obey the Laws of our LORD JESUS CHRIST. Be moſt hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and obſequious Subjects of his heavenly King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. Let His Throne be erected and eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſht in your Hearts; and make your very Souls ſubmit to the Scepter of His holy Government. Then (beſides that natural Peace and Delight which attend your Being and your Doing good;) you ſhall in time be ſenſible of a <hi>great Reward.</hi> And <hi>that</hi> Reward ſhall be <hi>great Comforts.</hi> And from thoſe Comforts ſhall flow <hi>great Pleaſures.</hi> Even ſuch Pleaſures as you want, and much better Pleaſures, than ye now ſeek; as being the beſt ſort which Heaven here gives, or Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals can receive. Do but believe, do but ſo far believe a faithful Informant, as to make a <hi>due Trial;</hi> and ye ſhall certainly <hi>find</hi> that thus it will be.</p>
               <pb n="90" facs="tcp:34484:52"/>
               <p>The other Word behind, is to be ſpoken to <hi>ſtrict and circumſpect Chriſtians.</hi> Let ſuch <hi>continue</hi> in their Zeal and Watchfulneſs, and labour to <hi>improve</hi> them. If they perſiſt not in their zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Vigilance, their great Reward will ſoon vaniſh into none at all. For tho' <hi>the fear of the</hi> LORD <hi>giveth Joy and Gladneſs, and is a</hi> Crown <hi>of rejoicing, Eccluſ.</hi> 1.11, 12: Yet if any that wear this ineſtimable <hi>Crown,</hi> ſhould give up Religion, and ceaſe to fear GOD; it would certainly and immediately fall from their Heads. When their Zeal flaggs, their Comforts muſt fail; and the quenching of the one, will extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh the other. And how will they be able to <hi>bear</hi> that? As the Sweetneſs of their Comforts is really ineffable; So the <hi>Loſs</hi> of the ſame (e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially if ſo unhappily occaſion'd) muſt be intolerable. A total Deprivation of ſuch in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparable Satisfactions, by their own Luke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warmneſs pull'd down upon themſelves, muſt needs reduce them to Saddeſt Trouble. I trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble almoſt to think how they'll indure it. They muſt ſurely want ſomething of <hi>Extraordinary Mercy</hi> even to keep them in their Wits.</p>
               <p>And then they muſt <hi>improve</hi> alſo in <hi>Zeal</hi> and <hi>Watchfulneſs,</hi> as well as <hi>perſiſt</hi> in them. So their great Reward will be made <hi>greater</hi> ſtill, and they ſhall add to the Degrees of their delightful Conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations. For tho' in regard theſe Comforts are free Iſſues of the ALMIGHTY's Goodneſs; He might diſpenſe them as <hi>arbitrarily</hi> as Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf pleaſeth, giving them when, and to whom, and in what meaſures He thinks fit: yet look what <hi>Rule</hi> He foretold He will go by, in diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buting the great and <hi>final</hi> Rewards; and the ſame, 'tis like, He'll obſerve in beſtowing theſe
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:34484:52"/> leſſer and intermediate ones. He'll apportion them, that is, to mens Works reſpectively. <hi>They</hi> ſhall have <hi>moſt</hi> of them, that <hi>do beſt:</hi> and they that by active and paſſive Duties, or elſe by both, bring greateſt Honour to His MAJE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>STY; ſhall probably have the largeſt ſhare of them at His hands.

               <argument>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A</hi> Fifth Motive <hi>to Mourning in General, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the</hi> Second Branch <hi>of that</hi> Bleſſedneſs <hi>which ſprings from the</hi> Comforts <hi>that at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend it:</hi> they confirm us in Religion <hi>by</hi> ſweetning it to us at the beginning; <hi>and by</hi> incouraging us in the Duties of it ever after.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>EVer ſince unhappy Man fell, and his Nature was debaſed by Original Corruption; his Mind hath ſtood bent, as it were, in a ſtiff and continual Tendency to Evil; and his Will hath been violently carri'd that way, by the Strong Biaſs of crooked Inclinations and Proclivities. So that now if at any time we become <hi>Religious,</hi> we muſt be drawn to it by a <hi>divine Power;</hi> and if for any time we continue ſo, we muſt be <hi>confirmed</hi> by the <hi>ſame.</hi> And this <hi>Confirmation</hi> is a bleſſed Fruit of Spiritual <hi>Comforts.</hi> And hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py is it for us, that they are effective of it. Elſe when we are entred on the Ways of GOD, and have devoted our ſelves to Him in the Laudable <hi>Beginnings</hi> of an holy Life; we ſhould quickly repent of our worthy Undertaking, it would prove ſo irkſom and uneaſy to us. Or if here and there <hi>one</hi> by the Force of <hi>Reaſon,</hi> and ſtrong Actings of <hi>Faith,</hi> could hold on in the Works of Obedience for a <hi>while,</hi> without having them ſweetned with theſe Conſolations; yet they are not <hi>many</hi> that would be able to do
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:34484:53"/> it. Eſpecially if we conſider, that when, <hi>firſt</hi> we give up our ſelves to Religion; beſides the buſy Corruptions of our Nature, we meet with many other troubleſome Oppoſitions, which greatly diſcourage us. So that ſhould not ſome Honey be mingled with our Gall; ſome high Conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations be mixt with thoſe Difficulties which meet us in our firſt Advances to GOD's Service, or Engagements in it; we ſhould ſoon grow weary of the Sacred Imployment, and willing to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign it, or, retreat from it. It pleaſes GOD therefore <hi>at,</hi> or ſometime <hi>after</hi> our Converſion to Himſelf, uſually to afford us good meaſures of His Comforts, to wedd us <hi>to,</hi> and to ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, us <hi>in</hi> the happy Way which we have cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen.</p>
               <p>The Laws of our Religion run high; and the Doctrines it teaches, and the Rules and Precepts which it lays before us, are ſtrangely excellent. But then being of a divine and lofty Pitch, they muſt be hard as well as uſeful. So that had Chriſtianity nothing but its own in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinſic Worth to induce Men to embrace it, and adhere unto it; without the Aſſiſtance of an extraordinary Grace, ſuch as perhaps is given but to <hi>few</hi>) its Duties would be <hi>too much</hi> for all thoſe that make up the main Body of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers. And conſequently were there not high Comforts in it (as well as ſpiritual Excellency) to recommend it; it would not gain many Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelytes to it ſelf. How many ſorever might <hi>offer</hi> at it; and venture ſo far as to make <hi>trial</hi> of it; but a ſmall number would heartily <hi>eſpouſe</hi> it, and prove its true and faithful Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirers. GOD therefore pities His tender Converts; and that they might not be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet

And thus it fairly falls in with whit we aſſert. That GOD by His Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort does uſually ſtrengthen Men, when they <hi>firſt</hi> undertake the true Religion. The effect of which is, it prevents their being damped, or too much diſheartned by any harſh Occurren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies; and eſtabliſhes them firmly in the Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of it.</p>
               <p>And no Wonder He ſhould favour theſe Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons ſo much. For like young Children, being unable to <hi>ſtand</hi> of themſelves, or to <hi>go alone</hi> as they ſhould; is in giving them theſe Comforts,
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:34484:55"/> He takes them by the Hand, as it were, to up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold and lead them. And good Reaſon there is (according to humane Judgment) why weak Chriſtians ſhould have ſtrongeſt Conſolations. Not only becauſe they are <hi>weak,</hi> but becauſe their Temptations may probably be <hi>more,</hi> and alſo more <hi>violent,</hi> than thoſe that are incident to the ſtrongeſt of all. For Satan, we may conclude, will fight moſt furiouſly, where he hath the beſt Proſpect, and moſt hopes of Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. Where He ſees the Fort of Virtue weakeſt, there he'll ply his fierceſt Batteries. 'Tis uſual with an Enemy to paſs by a Garriſon that is well fortifi'd, or a Caſtle that he thinks im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pregnable; and to attaque, or beſiege others, that are leſs able to hold out in a good Defence, or vigorous Reſiſtance. And 'tis very likely that our Spiritual Adverſary does ordinarily act at the ſame Rate. Where He ſees Chriſtians arm'd and well appointed to the Combate; their Graces ſtrong, their Judgments clear, their Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections warm, and themſelves Reſolute, and like to prove invincible: he paſſeth them by, and ingageth not with them. But where he ſpies out others that are weak and feeble, and unfit to conflict and grapple with Him; there he ſets on with rage and vehemence, expecting to vanquiſh and devour them. Reaſonable it is therefore (as was ſaid before, according to the judgment of Men) that weakeſt Chriſtians ſhould have ſtrongeſt Comforts. For as they meet with moſt and ſharpeſt Encounters per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, ſo they have leaſt Abilities to endure them. They who are moſt ſubject to faint, had need be ſuppli'd with beſt Cordials. And the good God hath taken care for this.</p>
               <pb n="97" facs="tcp:34484:55"/>
               <p>But farther; as holy Comforts thus help to <hi>fix</hi> us, ſo they help us as well to <hi>forward</hi> us in Religion. I mean, by <hi>incouraging</hi> us <hi>to,</hi> and <hi>in</hi> its <hi>Duties.</hi> To undertake to be Religious, is an eaſy Work, and ſoon done. And therefore in Countries where Chriſtianity prevails, there are few but embrace it. But then the miſery is, that theſe populous Multitudes, who take up Religion with ſeeming Seriouſneſs, are gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally plauſible Pretenders to it only, inſtead of ſincere Practitioners of it. They are nominal Chriſtians, but real Hypocrites; and the Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties they act, are but meer formal and theatri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal things. They may make a loud noiſe, and a fine ſhow, but they have nothing of Life, or Subſtance in them; and ſo nothing of true Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice to GOD, or Benefit to themſelves. And tho' ſuch as are ſincere, and thorough-pac'd Chriſtians, be commonly hearty in the Works of Religion; yet very often they are ſo back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward <hi>to</hi> them, and ſo heavy <hi>in</hi> them, that they want ſome help to overcome their Reluctancy, and to quicken their Dulneſs. Here therefore Comforts are helpful to them; in aiding them <hi>through</hi> thoſe weighty <hi>Duties,</hi> which are required of them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>If ye</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">Joh. 13.17.</note> 
                  <hi>know theſe things</hi> (ſaid our dear LORD) <hi>happy are ye if ye do them:</hi> ſignifying that Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians muſt not be Perſons of Speculation only, but of Practice. It is not enough for them to underſtand well, to think well, and to intend and reſolve well; unleſs they <hi>do</hi> ſo too. They muſt be active in the Offices incumbent on them; in all the good Works, which the Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion they profeſs, obliges them to perform. And theſe they muſt diſcharge with all good
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:34484:56"/> Conſcience and Perſeverance. But then we being to perſiſt in ſuch lofty Practices, which ſtand upon the exalted Principles of Chriſtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; there is no reaching them, and running through them, without conſiderable Pains, and ſome Uneaſineſs. And therefore we are taught by CHRIST Himſelf, that His Religion is both a <hi>Yoke,</hi> and a <hi>Burthen,</hi> S. <hi>Mat.</hi> 11.30. But then as He perfectly underſtands the Height of His own Laws, and the Frame of our Being; ſo He hath throughly experimented the Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties of Obedience, and the Infirmities of our Nature. And ſo we need not doubt but He will graciouſly diſpenſe his Comforts to us; and that in ſuch meaſures, as ſhall be moſt ſuitable to the Tasks which Himſelf hath impos'd, and as ſhall effectually aſſiſt us in the Performance of thoſe Tasks.</p>
               <p>For ſuch is the Powerful Virtue of theſe Comforts, that they wonderfully diſpoſe us to the Worſhip of GOD, and ſtrengthen us in it. Thus, as ſometimes when they come, They fill us with Longings after His Service, and make us even Reſtleſs till we are ingaged in it: So at other Times, when they viſit us in our actual Waitings on His Glorious MAJESTY, they ſo animate and inſpirit us, that we feel no Wearineſs at all in our Attendance. And when in any Periods or Circumſtances of our Life, we chance to grow down or dead in Devotion, and to droop and flag in our pious Exerciſes, and to be in danger of turning Lukewarm in Religion; no ſooner are they darted into our Souls, but they repleniſh us with freſh and live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Fervours. And theſe again inſpire us with ſuch Active Force, and vital Energy, as enable
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:34484:56"/> us to fulfill our Several Duties, not only with Content and chearful Alacrity; but always with <hi>true,</hi> and ſometimes with <hi>great</hi> Delight and Pleaſure. And thus our LORD's Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, tho' it be a Yoke, is made <hi>eaſy</hi> to us; and tho' it be a Burthen, is rendred <hi>Light;</hi> as Himſelf proclaims it in the fore-quoted Place.</p>
               <p>Nor do heavenly Comforts only inliven us in our dutiful Addreſſes to GOD, but alſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe holy <hi>Confidence</hi> into us. Such a Confidence as lifts us up into decent and modeſt <hi>Familiarity</hi> with His MAJESTY. So that whereas they who are deſtitute of Comforts, and dejected for want of them; do commonly approach Him with troubled Minds, and trembling Hearts; and are ſo overſet with the Senſe of <hi>His</hi> Excellencies, and their <hi>own</hi> Unworthineſs, that their Thoughts are diſordered, and their Duties diſpirited: We that enter GOD's Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence full of Peace, and make our devout Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lications to Him; do it at a far more happy Rate. For as we are wholly free from all ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifying Dread; ſo our filial Awe, and reveren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Fear, are mixt and incouraged with inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuous <hi>Boldneſs.</hi> With ſo baſhful and becoming a kind of Audacity, as recommends us to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and much facilitates our devotional Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances. And their Ruggedneſs and Uneaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs being thus taken off, or greatly abated; the Labour of them in good meaſure vaniſheth, and Religion turns moſtly into holy Recrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>To come more <hi>home</hi> to our purpoſe. Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Duties, as every one knows, are either <hi>Private,</hi> or <hi>Public:</hi> and divine <hi>Comforts</hi> are ready to attend and animate us in <hi>both,</hi> if we act them with Fidelity.</p>

                  <hi>we comprehend it not.</hi> The vaſtneſs and pregnancy of its ſenſe,
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:34484:57"/> makes us ſhallow Creatures incapable of concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving it. I only obſerve, it manifeſts thus much. That not only Comforts, but <hi>abundance</hi> of them ſhall be the Lot of ſuch as frequent God's Houſe, and <hi>publicly</hi> wait upon Him in His Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances.</p>
               <p>In this mortal State, Two of the greateſt Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfactions, as well as Supports of humane Life, are <hi>eating</hi> and <hi>drinking.</hi> And to the Gratifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions ariſing from theſe Natural Actions, the SPIRIT compares the <hi>Pleaſures</hi> which we feel in <hi>public</hi> Duties. But then becauſe the <hi>Quality</hi> of the things which we eat and drink, contributes mightily to the <hi>Pleaſure</hi> of doing ſo; therefore that the HOLY GHOST might the better ſet off the Luſciouſneſs of thoſe De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights, wherewith GOD favours us when we are zealous in Ordinances; He ſcrews up the compariſon by which He choſe to expreſs it, to the <hi>higheſt</hi> Pitch. For ſuppoſe a Man would <hi>Eat</hi> meerly for <hi>Pleaſure,</hi> and to the <hi>higheſt</hi> De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of Pleaſure that He could: What then could he deſire to Eat of better than <hi>Fat things?</hi> Eſpecially if they were ſet in great Plenty be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Him, and he might eat of them freely and to ſatiety. And therefore the good SPIRIT gives us to underſtand, that they who conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onably reſort to GOD's Houſe, ſhall there feed upon <hi>Fatneſs:</hi> and not only ſo, but ſhall be <hi>ſatisfied</hi> likewiſe, and <hi>abundantly</hi> ſatisfied there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with. The Pleaſures, that is, which they are ſenſible of in GOD's public Service, ſhall be equivalent to thoſe which the Hungry perceive in eating choiceſt Viands; if not far ſurmount them. And ſo if a man were diſpoſed to <hi>Drink</hi> his <hi>fill,</hi> and with greateſt <hi>Delight;</hi> where could
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:34484:58"/> He do it ſo well as out of a <hi>River?</hi> A River of Wine, Suppoſe, or of Milk and Honey: by which laſt ſort, the holy Book deſcribes a plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful and pleaſant Land. But then imagine there were a River running nothing but <hi>Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures,</hi> and whoſe Streams conſiſt wholly of Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents of <hi>Sweetneſs:</hi> would not full Draughts out of ſuch a River (that flows with the cleareſt Oblectations) moſt ſtrangely ſatisfy us? Yet juſt ſuch is that <hi>River,</hi> that River of <hi>Comforts,</hi> which flows in GOD's Houſe. When our Souls drink of it, it inebriates them, as I may ſay, with holy Joys, and fills them with Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures and divine Delights, like thoſe at GOD's Right Hand for ever.</p>
               <p>Which conſidered, we need not (by the way) wonder at that ſtrange <hi>Paſſion</hi> which raged in King <hi>David</hi> and tranſported Him with deſire of joining in GOD's Worſhip, when He was in Exile, and under unhappy Excluſion from it.<note n="*" place="margin">ver. 2.</note>

               <p>Now <hi>how came it</hi> to be thus with the King of <hi>Iſrael?</hi> What <hi>occaſion'd</hi> theſe extraordinary Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections and Emotions of his? In all likelihood at preſent he was <hi>baniſht.</hi> And being unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately driven out of his Territories, his Mind
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:34484:58"/> one would think, might have been <hi>taken up</hi> with that ſad calamity. Or elſe the buſy thoughts of <hi>recovering</hi> his Crown and Kingdom, from which he was forced, ſhould have <hi>ingroſs'd</hi> it in a manner entirely to themſelves. Yet we plainly ſee, that it ſtood quite another way; even to GOD's Worſhip, and the Place where it was publicly celebrated. The loſs of <hi>theſe</hi> was that which he lamented; and the Reinjoyment of them was that which he deſired. For <hi>theſe</hi> he longed, for <hi>theſe</hi> he thirſted, and that ſo vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently, that his very Soul <hi>panted,</hi> and even <hi>fainted</hi> for them. But why ſo? There muſt be ſome good Reaſon for ſo great Eagerneſs; ſome mighty Cauſe of ſo marvellous an Effect. And truly he more than inſinuates what it was, where he tells us (as before was noted) that his Soul thirſted to ſee GOD's <hi>Power</hi> and <hi>Glory</hi> as he had ſeen it in the <hi>Sanctuary.</hi> There's an Anſwer to the Query, which may well ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfy us without ſeeking farther.</p>
               <p>The excellent Prince, as he was a conſtant frequenter of GOD's <hi>Houſe,</hi> ſo he was through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly acquainted with that <hi>River</hi> of <hi>Pleaſures</hi> which flowed in it. He had very often been very ſenſible of thoſe truly Powerful, and Glorious <hi>Comforts,</hi> which there deſcend upon the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of GOD: and this made him ſo paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onately and impatiently deſirous of joining with them in public Duties.</p>
               <p>Now if ſuch meaſures of divine Comforts as produced theſe Effects, came down upon the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious in their public Performances under the <hi>Law:</hi> what Fulneſs of Comforts muſt reſt upon thoſe, in their ſacred Offices, who are faithful <hi>Profeſſors</hi> of the <hi>Goſpel?</hi> For as betwixt the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:34484:59"/> and Evangelical Diſpenſations, there is as much difference, as there is between <hi>Moſes</hi> and CHRIST; ſo between the reſpective <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts</hi> of each, there is as great Difference, as there is betwixt the cloudieſt, and the clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Day; or betwixt the riſing, and the meridian Sun.</p>
               <p>But then hence it will follow that Chriſtians who exceed the <hi>Jews</hi> in <hi>comforts,</hi> ſhould excell them as to <hi>Duties,</hi> and the Service of GOD; as having more excellent Incouragements to the ſame. And ſo in Truth they do. The match<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Comforts which they there meet with, do greatly indear GOD's Houſe and Ordinances. They make them forward <hi>to</hi> them, and alſo pleaſed <hi>with,</hi> and <hi>in</hi> them, beyond all Meaſure, and Expreſſion. When in outward communion with the great GOD, they feel themſelves af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected with inward Conſolations; with deep Senſations of Divine Pleaſure, and ineffable Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions of raviſhing Delights: the high Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factions they find in His Ordinances, do ſtrangely captivate their very Souls, and moſt ſweetly enamour them on the ſame. So ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and paſſionately, that if all this World, and a thouſand better, were profer'd to draw them from thoſe Ordinances, they would be no Temptation in the Leaſt to them, to relinquiſh and deſert them. They would refuſe any thing, they would reject every thing, and that with holy Rage and ſcornful Indignation; rather than chooſe to be barred from GOD's Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances,<note n="*" place="margin">In San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cto magna eſt conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latio, in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 36.8.</note> where they perceive ſuch an affluence of Comforts. For as S. <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſays, in the Sanctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary, there is great Conſolation.</p>
               <pb n="105" facs="tcp:34484:59"/>
               <p>And this I muſt add. That the plenty of divine Comforts which they there meet with, are not only happily <hi>felt</hi> by themſelves; but are ſometimes plainly <hi>ſeen</hi> by others, in lively Symptoms or Indications, hard to be conceal'd. Thus I have obſerv'd of zealous Chriſtians, that after their Converſe with GOD in Duty, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly at His own Myſterious Table; a more than ordinary lightſom pleaſant Air hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared in their Faces. Their hidden Joys have ſhined in their Countenances; and that they abounded with inward Conſolations, was out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly manifeſt in their ſprightly Viſages. I could diſcern methoughts, that they had received JE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SUS, by the ſerious, graceful Gayneſs of their Aſpects; and the Spirits have danc'd ſo chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully in their Eyes, as if their heavenly LORD taken into their Hearts, had looked out at thoſe ſparkling Windows.</p>
               <p>Now where ſuch mighty <hi>Comforts</hi> as theſe fall in with holy Duties <hi>Private</hi> and <hi>Public;</hi> they muſt ſtrangely invigorate the Performers of them, and bring in ſuch Acceſſions of Heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Strength, as will effectually conduce to their Settlement in Religion. And they that are fixt in true Religion, may well paſs for <hi>bleſſed</hi> here on Earth. So they were accounted, and ever eſteemed by the beſt of Men; and ſo they muſt <hi>be</hi> according to the Word of the infallible GOD.</p>
               <p>For the HOLY GHOST ſpeaking of ſuch a one in the firſt <hi>Pſalm,</hi> deſcribes him thus. <hi>His delight is in the Law of the</hi> LORD, <hi>and in His Law doth he meditate Day and Night.</hi> He is ſo well grounded and confirmed in Religion, that he is always ſtudying the <hi>Law</hi> of Heaven,
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:34484:60"/> in order to the conſcionable Keeping of it. That is his <hi>Temper;</hi> but what's His <hi>Condition?</hi> No leſs than <hi>Bleſſed,</hi> as the firſt Word of that <hi>Pſalm</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms us.

               <p>AS there is nothing more excellent than true Religion, in its <hi>Nature;</hi> ſo of all things it leads to the moſt incomparable <hi>Ends.</hi> For beſides, that it here renews us in our Minds and Spirits, and transforms us into the beaute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Image of GOD; it fits us by degrees for immenſe Joys above, and tranſlates us at laſt into the glorious Felicities of the eternal World. And then over and above theſe admirable <hi>prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal</hi> Ends of it; there are many <hi>collateral</hi> or by-Advantages to which it ſerves: and of theſe <hi>Aſſurance</hi> is one of ſpecial Note and Worth.

               <p>That there <hi>is</hi> ſuch a Thing, may fairly be inferr'd from the Intimations of it given us from Heaven. Some think they meet with it, in 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.10.

                  </note> 
                  <hi>It is Hope ſtrengthned by ſome firm Opinion.</hi> They that would riſe <hi>higher</hi> in Aſſurance than thus, muſt go out of this World, and go into Heaven. And there, as Faith ſhall be converted to bleſſed Viſion; So Hope ſhall be turned into actual Fruition.</p>
               <p>But tho' it be impoſſible that Aſſurance here ſhould be raiſed higher than a <hi>full Perſuaſion,</hi> or Certitude of <hi>Hope;</hi> yet divine Comforts do ſtrangely quicken and invigorate it. When <hi>they</hi> at any time come upon this <hi>Aſſurance,</hi> or back and ſecond it, in way of Acceſſion or Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition to it; like the Broad Seal upon a Royal Patent, they throughly ratify it. And therefore indeed I call them the <hi>Seal</hi> of Aſſurance. For
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:34484:62"/> as a Seal confirms the Deeds to which it is put; ſo Comforts ſupervenient to Chriſtians <hi>Aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,</hi> are a means to make it more <hi>ſound</hi> and unqueſtionable. Whoever are happy in the ſweet <hi>Plerophory,</hi> or full Aſſurance we ſpeak of; when their <hi>Comforts</hi> come, they ſtamp it for Current, or <hi>Legitimate.</hi> And no marvel they ſhould, when they really bring with them an ante-taſt of Heaven it ſelf; and are thoſe very Joys, in a lower Degree, which ſhall crown the Saints in the State of their Felicity.</p>
               <p>And as theſe Comforts thus prove or <hi>evidence</hi> our Aſſurance to be genuine; ſo if any <hi>Diſcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſures</hi> chance to befall it, or any Interruptions, or <hi>Breaches</hi> happen in it; they are uſeful to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dintegrate, or make it <hi>whole</hi> again. For as highly pleaſing as this Aſſurance is, and as loth as Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians ſhould be to part with it upon that Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count: it may yet be <hi>diminiſht</hi> and miſerably <hi>deſtroyed</hi> by their own Follies. Tho' it be never ſo well ſettled, it may be convuls'd and <hi>ſhaken</hi> by their Sins of <hi>Infirmity;</hi> yea, disjointed and <hi>ſhattered</hi> by their Sins of <hi>Preſumption.</hi> But then to the <hi>Reſtoration</hi> and <hi>Re-eſtabliſhment</hi> of it, holy <hi>Comforts</hi> contribute in <hi>both</hi> Caſes.</p>
               <p>Firſt, In caſe it be <hi>weakened</hi> by Sins of <hi>Infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity.</hi> Good Chriſtians that have pure Minds, have alſo nice and tender Conſciences. And thoſe Failures which are little to others, and ſeem as light as Feathers; to <hi>them</hi> are great, and heavy, and troubleſome. They lie upon them as Ponderous Loads, and the Preſſures of them are very uneaſy. The Darkneſs of their Underſtandings, the Crookedneſs of their Wills, the Violence of their Appetites, the Turbulency
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:34484:62"/> of their Paſſions, the Weakneſs of their Virtues, the Shortneſs of their Attainments, the Slight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of their Performances, (things which ſlip the Notice, or are little obſerved by <hi>moſt</hi> in the World) to <hi>them</hi> are extreamly grievous and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictive. They ruffle their Minds, and diſturb their Thoughts, and diſcompoſe their Spirits, and diſorder their Judgments; inſomuch that at times they are ready to ſuſpect, and ready to conclude, that GOD, by reaſon of their manifold Infirmities, can neither <hi>approve</hi> of their <hi>Duties</hi> in this Life, nor <hi>admit</hi> their <hi>Perſons</hi> to the <hi>Happineſs</hi> of the next. And theſe Fears in many, do ſo ſhock their Faith, that they have much ado to bear up againſt them, and to keep from ſinking into down-right Deſpondency; eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally where their Nature is tinctur'd with <hi>Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But here now let holy <hi>Comforts</hi> come in; and how grateful<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> a Change will they bring along with them? They that are moſt caſt down at their Infirmities, and ſit invelop'd with the blackeſt diſconſolate Clouds; by the Riſing of theſe bright <hi>Comforts</hi> upon them, will be hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily relieved. The Darkneſs about them ſhall be quite diſpell'd, and the Clouds that covered them ſhall be utterly ſcatter'd, and the Fears that diſturb'd them ſhall not only vaniſh, but vaniſh immediately. They ſhall paſs away as the early Dew, or fly, like Miſts, before the Morning-Sun: So that not ſo much as the leaſt Mark, or Token, or Shadow of them ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main. And the ſame Beams of Comfort which by ſhining into their Hearts, do diſperſe thoſe Fears which were gathered about them; and diſſipate thoſe Clouds of Darkneſs which en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compaſs'd
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:34484:63"/> them; and drive away thoſe Damps of Grief and Trouble which were riſen within them: will not ſtop here. No, they go on to the production of a farther Effect. For having freed them from Darkneſs (as before) proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from the over-ſetting Apprehenſion of their <hi>Infirmities;</hi> they fill them next with the Light of <hi>Joy:</hi> which lifting them up into a confident Hope of Peace with GOD, and of His Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Favour; in that Perſuaſion their <hi>Aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance</hi> is re-ſettled.</p>
               <p>Secondly, They exert themſelves in another piece of Influence. They <hi>reſtore</hi> Aſſurance, when <hi>broken</hi> and ſhattered by Sins of <hi>Preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> The beſt upon Earth, are not only ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to Sins of Infirmity (which are oftener Sins of <hi>Omiſſion</hi> than of <hi>Commiſſion;</hi> as their not Praying, Hearing, Receiving the Sacrament, and the like, ſo <hi>well</hi> and <hi>worthily</hi> as they ſhould:) but may ſometimes by the powerful Importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of Temptation (taking the advantage of their frailty and inadvertency) be drawn into wilful and <hi>preſumptuous Enormities.</hi> Now when fierce Temptation hath prevailed upon their <hi>careleſneſs,</hi> rather than their <hi>weakneſs,</hi> (for they have Strengths ſufficient to <hi>reſiſt</hi> the Devil, if they would but uſe them, as appears by<note n="*" place="margin">Chap. 4. 7.</note> S. <hi>James</hi>'s Command to do it) they ſoon feel themſelves in an uneaſy Condition. Nor can they do otherwiſe, conſidering what Terrors attend the Perpetration of groſs Impieties; and how deeply they pierce into pious Souls by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of their Religious Softneſs and Tenderneſs. And when Folly hath unhappily betray'd us in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Sin, and that Sin hath fill'd us with Horrors
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:34484:63"/> and Stings; if then our Guilt pricks us in the<note n="*" place="margin">Act. 2.37.</note> Heart, and we be wounded <hi>for</hi> it, as well as <hi>by</hi> it; here's another Scene for holy Comforts to act in. For ſuch is their Sovereign Medici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Virtue, that they help to cure our Spiritual Wounds, where GOD applies them to that purpoſe. An Hint of this is given us, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 147.3. <hi>He healeth the broken in Heart, and bind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth up their Wounds.</hi> Sins are <hi>Wounds</hi> in all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects. They <hi>come</hi> as Wounds uſually do, from the hands of <hi>Enemies;</hi> They have the <hi>Corruption</hi> of Wounds, the <hi>Anguiſh</hi> of Wounds, and the <hi>Danger</hi> of Wounds in them; nor can they be healed without a skilful <hi>Chirurgeon.</hi> For they are Wounds in the Soul, Wounds in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, and ſo the worſt and dreadfulleſt Wounds that can be; and never to be healed but by the ALMIGHTY's Surgery. And when His Mercy takes ſuch Wounds in hand; beſides His free <hi>Grace,</hi> and the <hi>Bloud</hi> of His SON, one Ingredient which He ſtill makes uſe of, is the <hi>Oil</hi> of <hi>Gladneſs,</hi> or Infuſion of holy <hi>Comforts.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For the better underſtanding of this, we muſt know that Sin always wounds us <hi>two ways</hi> at once: that is to ſay, in our <hi>Souls,</hi> and in our <hi>Minds.</hi> Our Souls it wounds with <hi>Guilt;</hi> and our Minds with <hi>Trouble.</hi> The Medicine for the <hi>firſt</hi> Wounds is true <hi>Repentance,</hi> which carrying Pardon continually with it, does ſo become a moſt perfect Cure of all thoſe Wounds which are made in our <hi>Souls,</hi> be they never ſo deep and deadly. And where <hi>Comforts</hi> take place, as in this caſe they ſuppoſe an <hi>antecedent</hi> Pardon; So withal they <hi>aſcertain</hi> us of it: and <hi>that</hi>'s the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicament which heals Wounds in our <hi>Minds.</hi>
                  <pb n="114" facs="tcp:34484:64"/> For we being thus certifi'd that our Sins are par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned, and conſequently that GOD's Favour to us is renewed; this rids us of our Fears, and frees us from our Scruples, and lifts us up plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſingly into that <hi>Aſſurance</hi> from which we were fallen.</p>
               <p>And truly without this, were we never ſo penitent and actually <hi>pardoned,</hi> we could hardly be <hi>pacifi'd.</hi> For every deliberate and notorious Sin makes a wide <hi>Breach,</hi> and Breeds a ſad <hi>Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference</hi> between GOD and us. And tho' upon our Repentance the <hi>Breach</hi> be <hi>made</hi> up, and the Difference be <hi>reconciled;</hi> yet this is not enough. 'Tis enough for our <hi>ſafety</hi> indeed, but not enough for our <hi>ſatisfaction.</hi> For when Souls have grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouſly offended GOD, and broken their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Peace with Him; they can never be at quiet till they are ſenſible of His Love, the ſame way that they were ſenſible of His Diſpleaſure. His Diſpleaſure, when they had ſinned, they felt in their Minds and Conſciences, by woful Gripings, and amazing Terrors. And when upon Repentance, they perceive His Kindneſs the ſame way, by a freſh Recovery of Peace in their Minds and Conſciences; <hi>then</hi> they will be ſatisfi'd, but not till then. But that which muſt create this Aſſuring Peace, or raiſe it in us, is Holy <hi>Comfort.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And therefore it is remarkable, that when <hi>David</hi> had committed hainous Sin againſt GOD, he did not only ſeek Reconciliation to His MAJESTY, but ſue to have his loſt Comforts reſtored: <hi>make me to hear of</hi> Joy <hi>and</hi> Gladneſs, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51.8. And <hi>reſtore unto me the Joy of thy Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, v.</hi> 12th. Which Joy and Gladneſs, when GOD is pleas'd to pour them into our Hearts,
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:34484:64"/> and to ſignify thereby that He hath not only graciouſly <hi>forgiven</hi> our Sins, but alſo was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward by theſe ſweet Conſolations to <hi>acquaint</hi> us with the ſame; muſt neceſſarily convince us of the favourable Renovation of His fatherly Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; and be a <hi>ſealed Aſſurance</hi> of our preſent Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity, and of our Happineſs to come; provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded we keep our Integrity to the End.</p>
               <p>And tho' it be a <hi>mighty</hi> Virtue which divine Comforts muſt have in themſelves, to drown the Clamours of the Loudeſt Guilt, be they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo ſhrill and hideous; and when they have ſtifled and ſilenc'd them, to cauſe <hi>full Aſſurance</hi> to ſpring up in their Room: yet that they ſhould contain ſo <hi>forcible</hi> a Power, is not to be wondred at. For they are not only ſure <hi>grounds</hi> upon which we may hope for Peace with Heaven; but are indeed <hi>that Peace</hi> it ſelf proclaim'd aloud in Penitents Conſciences.</p>
               <p>But then this <hi>Aſſurance</hi> proceeding from theſe <hi>Comforts,</hi> and theſe Comforts being procurable by Holy <hi>Mourning;</hi> what good Man who conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders it well, would not ſet Himſelf to <hi>Mourn,</hi> that ſo he may be comforted, and thus <hi>aſſured?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>O Chriſtian! is not Aſſurance a moſt deſira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, is it not a moſt invaluable Bleſſing? They that injoy it, are too happy to have their Feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city deſcrib'd; tho' theſe may be ſome faint or imperfect <hi>Hints</hi> of it. They are raiſed in their Minds; they are generous in their Thoughts; they are lofty in their Deſires; they are chearful in their Spirits; they are even in their Tempers; they are ſweet in their Diſpoſitions; they are pleaſing in their Converſe; they are innocent in their Carriage; they are pure in their Intentions; they are upright in their Proceedings. And if we
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:34484:65"/> paſs a little higher, I mean, from their <hi>civil</hi> to their <hi>religious</hi> Capacities, and obſerve them <hi>there;</hi> we ſhall find them as laudable in divine Accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhments. For how ſtrong are they in Faith? How joyful through Hope? How full of Fear and Love to GOD; and of Kindneſs and Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to all Men? How confident are they in De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votions? How unconcern'd in Dangers? How patient in Sufferings? How invincible in Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles? How fearleſs and reſigned as to Death? How firm in Believing, how chearful in Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting, how conſtant in Looking, how earneſt in Wiſhing, how eager in Longing for the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Judgment? In one word, <hi>innumerable</hi> are the Benefits of this Aſſurance, as well as <hi>ineſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable.</hi> Let me name but <hi>two</hi> more, and inſiſt a little upon them. It makes Religion very <hi>eaſy</hi> to <hi>us,</hi> and <hi>us</hi> to be very <hi>zealous</hi> in <hi>that.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt, It makes <hi>Religion</hi> very <hi>eaſy</hi> to <hi>us.</hi> The Stronger he that labours is, the leſs irkſom are his Works. And the more we are ſtrengthned<note n="*" place="margin">Eph 3.16.</note> in the inner Man, the leſs difficult will our Spiritual Exerciſes be. Now Aſſurance <hi>corrobo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates</hi> us within. It warms our Affections with an holy Vigour, and an heavenly Sprightlineſs, and ſo (making us<note n="†" place="margin">Eph. 6.10.</note> 
                  <hi>ſtrong in the</hi> LORD, <hi>and in the Power of his Might</hi>) does greatly facilitate Religion to us. It is not the weight of things, that makes them hard to be born, ſo we have but ſtrength proportionable to bear them. The Poſts, and Gates, and Barrs of a City, were nothing for a <hi>Sampſon</hi> to take upon his Shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, and to carry them away even to the Top of an Hill. Aſſurance turns us into Spiritual <hi>Sampſons.</hi> If we were Children before, it makes
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:34484:65"/> us Men: and if we were Men, it makes us Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants. It fills us with ſuch noble Heat, as raiſes our Strengths up to our Tasks; and apportions our Abilities to our Imployments. And then the weightieſt Duties which lie upon our Hands, become not only practicable, but delightful; and the ſerious and conſtant performance of them, turns into the trueſt and moſt entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Pleaſure of our whole Life. And who would not purchaſe ſuch a pleaſure at the price of Mourning?</p>
               <p>O the dull and weary Pace that many walk in the ways of Duty! O the black and diſmal Accuſations wherewith they charge them! O the grievous and bitter Complaints which they make againſt them! CHRIST's eaſy Yoke galls their Necks, and his light Burthen breaks their Backs; and they are ready to cry out, they know not how to endure them. I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not Believe, I cannot Hope, I cannot Pray; I cannot be Meek, I cannot be Humble, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be Patient. When the Devil tempts, I know I ſhould reſiſt Him; when the World flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, I know I ſhould deſpiſe it; when the Fleſh entices, I know I ſhould deny it; but I cannot, alas, I am not able to do it. This is the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortleſs language of Thouſands; and thus with Sorrow in their Hearts, and with Tears in their Eyes, they bewail the Hardneſs of their incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bent Duties. But now would ſuch as theſe but change the Scene a little which they act in, and turn their <hi>penſive</hi> into <hi>pious</hi> Mourning; the Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent of their Grief would ſoon be ſtopped, and the Fountain of their Lamentation dried up. For the Difficulties in Religion would quickly disband, and the things they complain of as
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:34484:66"/> toilſome and troubleſome, would be matter of Eaſe and Satisfaction to them. And can we ſtick at <hi>Mourning,</hi> or any other Performance, to bring this about?</p>
               <p>Think, O Chriſtians! and conſider well with your ſelves! Will it not be an happy, a moſt happy Caſe, when our Duties ſhall be turned into high Divertiſements, and divine Recreation? When it ſhall be our Meat and Drink to do the Will of our heavenly Father? When our Minds ſhall always be inclin'd to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Heaven, and our Hearts be ſweetly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected with Religion? When we ſhall freely yield up our ſelves to the Government of our LORD, and chearfully follow the Conduct of His SPIRIT? When abhorring all treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Delights of Sin, we ſhall devote our ſelves to the Love and Service of GOD, ſtudying His Will, and rejoycing to obey it? Conſider wiſely, I ſay, and then ſpeak, if this will not be a moſt bleſſed Condition. Yet be but per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded to be Holy <hi>Mourners,</hi> and <hi>ye</hi> ſhall be <hi>ſome</hi> of theſe Bleſſed Creatures. Then ye ſhall heartily chooſe the ways of Righteouſneſs, and run on in them with little Pains, and aſcend to Heaven with a great deal of Eaſe. For then ye ſhall be ſtrong in Faith, and lively in Hope, and fervent in Love; and fit to Pray, and ſwift to Hear, and ready to Practiſe; and all the Parts of Evangelical Obedience ſhall be but matter of Complacence to you.</p>
               <p>Let all that are good, Remember this, and by it be induc'd to what I urge. Would we not be glad to have our Duties naturalized and made eaſy? Would we not be glad to act GOD's Will with as much Readineſs and
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:34484:66"/> Alacrity, as ever we did Satan's or our own? Would it not Rejoyce us, and Rejoyce us ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly, to ſee all thoſe huge and mountain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Difficulties, over which we thought we ſhould never be able to climb; quite levell'd and made plain before us, and ſo plain, as to be pleaſant to us? Yet by Religious Mourning may this be done. For <hi>that</hi> makes way for holy <hi>Comforts,</hi> and They will bring on heavenly <hi>Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance;</hi> the certain Cauſe of this deſirable Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The ſame Aſſurance which makes Religion <hi>eaſy</hi> to <hi>us;</hi> will make <hi>US zealous</hi> in <hi>that.</hi> They who labour for uncertain Wages, want the chief Motive to Diligence, and ſo may well be cold in their Work. GOD there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, to baniſh all Chilneſs out of us in His Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, hath ſet a moſt incomparable Recompence before us. And as the <hi>ſight</hi> of that Reward (if beheld with fixt and unprejudiced Eyes) is enough to cure <hi>Lukewarmneſs;</hi> ſo <hi>Aſſurance</hi> of it is enough to inflame our <hi>Zeal</hi> in the ways of Godlineſs. What, can we believe that GOD is our Father, that CHRIST is our RE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DEEMER, and that the HOLY GHOST is our conſtant appointed COMFORTER? Can we believe fiducially that we have GOD's Graces to ſanctify us? His Power to guard us, His Laws to guide us, and His Providence to take care of us? Can we firmly believe, that we are happily related to the adorable TRI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NITY; that Heaven is ours even to Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, and that Death it ſelf (as formidable an Evil as many think it) is but the Term of our Miſery, and a ſafe Paſſage into bleſſed Immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality? Can we ſtedfaſtly believe that we ſhall
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:34484:67"/> one day ſhine, as bright as the Sun, and dwell above as high as the Stars, and become as pure and glorious as the Angels, and be made as bleſſed as our Hearts can wiſh? Can we thus believe, I ſay, and be competently <hi>aſſured</hi> of all this, and not be <hi>zealous</hi> in the Works of GOD? That's impoſſible, as it is for Combuſtibles to lie in the Fire and not be burnt. Yet <hi>Mourning</hi> brings on this Faith and <hi>Aſſurance.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>O let us mourn then, let us mourn Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly that ſo we may be <hi>comforted;</hi> and ſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted as to be thus <hi>aſſured.</hi> Then our Aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance will elevate our <hi>Zeal,</hi> and our Zeal will exalt us in the Practice of Righteouſneſs. Exalt us to ſuch an extraordinary Pitch, as that we ſhall not only be Good our ſelves, but rarely <hi>exemplary</hi> unto others. For it will make us to be Lambs in the midſt of Wolves, and Doves in the midſt of Vultures. It will make us Saints in this World of Sinners; and while we are but Men, will make us live like Angels. It will make us ſhine like Lights to all about us, and cauſe us to ſhame their baſeneſs by our purity and brightneſs. And tho' we cannot change the Hearts of the diſſolute, yet it will help us to dazle their Eyes. I mean, by the beauteous Luſtre of our Innocent Behaviour, and the ſparkling Glories of an uniform Righteouſneſs.</p>
               <p>I add but this. As <hi>Aſſurance</hi> helps to beget <hi>Zeal,</hi> ſo <hi>Zeal</hi> again helps to ſtrengthen <hi>Aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,</hi> as being one of the beſt and moſt evident Tokens of religious Sincerity. If a Man Hears, and Speaks, and Breathes, and Moves; we may be ſure he is <hi>alive:</hi> theſe are undeniable Symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms of <hi>that.</hi> So if we hear GOD in His <hi>Word,</hi> and ſpeak to Him in <hi>Prayer,</hi> and breathe
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:34484:67"/> after Him in <hi>Deſires,</hi> and beſtir our ſelves in His <hi>Service,</hi> and do all this with <hi>zealous</hi> Dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence: here's abundant Proof of Spiritual <hi>Life</hi> in us.</p>
               <p>And one main Reaſon why People are gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally ſo full of <hi>Doubts,</hi> and ſo much in the Dark, as to their own Sincerity and Salvation; is their <hi>want</hi> of <hi>fervent Zeal</hi> in Duty. Did <hi>that</hi> but burn in their Souls as it ſhould, it would yield ſuch a clear and convincing Light, as that by it they might eaſily diſcern their Integrity, and be well <hi>aſſured</hi> of their Approaching Happineſs.</p>
               <p>Let as many therefore as would be <hi>bleſſed</hi> upon Earth, <hi>mourn</hi> piouſly, conſidering what this Chapter ſays. For by ſo doing they ſhall be greatly <hi>comforted,</hi> and by their Comforts their <hi>Aſſurance</hi> ſhall be <hi>ſealed.</hi> Which being done, Religion ſhall become very <hi>eaſy</hi> to <hi>them,</hi> and they ſhall become very <hi>zealous</hi> in <hi>that;</hi> and ſo ſhall be <hi>more</hi> Aſſured and Bleſſed ſtill.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>A <hi>Seventh Motive</hi> to Mourning in General, being the <hi>Fourth Branch</hi> of that <hi>Bleſſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> which riſes from the <hi>Comforts</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed to <hi>Mourning: They ſupport us in Afflictions.</hi> Which are incident to <hi>all,</hi> tho' <hi>moſtly</hi> to the <hi>Righteous. Good Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians</hi> need not fear Afflictions. Tho' <hi>others</hi> are <hi>unhappy</hi> under them.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>TRue are the Words of the Son of <hi>Sirach:</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">Ecclus. 40.1, 3, 4.5, 6.</note> 
                  <hi>Great Travel is created for every Man, and an heavy Yoke is upon the Sons of</hi> Adam, <hi>from the day that they go out of their Mothers Womb, till the day that they return to the Mother of all things. Even from him that ſitteth on a Throne of Glory, unto him that is humbled in Earth and Aſhes; from him that weareth Purple, and a Crown, unto him that is clothed with a Linnen Frock; there is Trouble and unquietneſs, and little or nothing is his Reſt.</hi> But then how inconceivably Good is our Gracious GOD! For as He rais'd and rankt us high at firſt, in the Claſſis, or Order of the animal Creation (by induing Man with a reaſonable Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and making Him Head of this Sublunary World:) So He hath taken great care of that excellent Being wherewith He honoured us, even <hi>now</hi> ſince Man unworthily debas'd it, and ſhamefully ruin'd it, and brought many grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous Neceſſities upon it. Thus, as He hath prepared heavenly <hi>Graces,</hi> to help our pitiable Weakneſſes, and Infirmities; So He hath provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:34484:68"/> holy <hi>Comforts</hi> to ſuſtain us in our various Sufferings and <hi>Afflictions.</hi> And theſe ſupporting Comforts in good People, is the next piece of <hi>Bleſſedneſs</hi> which we are to conſider.</p>
               <p>In caſe we think but <hi>what</hi> we <hi>are,</hi> and <hi>where</hi> we <hi>live;</hi> that we are <hi>Men,</hi> and that we dwell upon the <hi>Earth:</hi> we ſhall ſoon be convinc'd that we are expoſed to <hi>Miſeries,</hi> and that they will inevitably fall upon us. And therefore <hi>Job</hi> laid it down as a certain Aphoriſm, which he had found moſt true by ſad Experience, as well as Obſervation; that<note n="*" place="margin">Job 14.1.</note> 
                  <hi>Man born of a Woman is full of Trouble.</hi> So far from being empty or void of Miſeries, that he is <hi>brim-full</hi> of thoſe bitter Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. Theſe are Streams that flow through the whole courſe of Mans Life. They begin to ſpring at His Birth, and he muſt wade through them to his Grave. He is born crying, and he dieth ſighing; he takes his Life, and he leaves His Breath with a Sorrowful Accent. And ſo common is this Evil, that none indeed can be exempted from it. 'Tis a general Infelicity up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all Mankind. Yea, ever ſince the Fall, <hi>Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi> ſeems to be complicated or twiſted with our very <hi>conſtitution.</hi> 'Tis ſo inſeparable from us, that I had almoſt called it a <hi>Property</hi> of our Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, wherewith it is ſignifi'd to be <hi>naturally</hi> coin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident, <hi>Job</hi> 5.7. <hi>Man is born to trouble, as the Sparks fly upward.</hi> As if it were not more na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural for Sparks to aſcend, than for Man to be afflicted. And if Men as <hi>Men</hi> be ſubject to Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions; then if they be <hi>good</hi> and <hi>pious</hi> Men, their Afflictions muſt be numerous. For Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Religion ſoften Mens nature, and makes them tender and paſſive, and ſo apt to be ſtruck with <hi>ſpiritual</hi> Evils, that produce ſuch
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:34484:69"/> pungent Troubles, as the ungodly are wholly unacquainted with; and by reaſon of the hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of their Hearts, and the Deadneſs of their Conſciences, can in no meaſure be ſenſible of. And then the ſame Goodneſs and Religion heighten Mens <hi>Relations</hi> to GOD, and to His People; and the more nearly at any time they are related to both, the more paſſionately con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd will they be for either, when Injuries or Indignities (which fall under their Notice) are thrown upon them. Yea, according to the Spirit and Temper, and Law of their Religion, they are ſolicitous for the welfare of their worſt <hi>enemies,</hi> and deeply affected with their misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes and miſcarriages; eſpecially with their ſins, and the grievous Dangers to which they expoſe them. And thus Afflictions muſt needs be multipli'd and much increaſed to the Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious, while they are made obnoxious to many troubles, which others are ignorant and incapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of; and while by virtue of their charitable and affectionate Sympathy, the Sufferings of <hi>other</hi> People, in a good Degree, are made their <hi>own.</hi> This of neceſſity muſt mightily augment the Afflictions of the Righteous by adding in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable <hi>foreign</hi> Troubles (as I may call them) to their own private and perſonal Hardſhips. Never let us wonder therefore to ſee <hi>David</hi> in a Deluge, on every ſide ſurrounded, or rather quite overwhelm'd with an inundation of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries. <hi>I am come into deep Waters where the Floods overflow me, Pſal.</hi> 69.2. Which might well cauſe him to petition as he did;<note n="*" place="margin">v. 14, 15.</note> 
                  <hi>Let me be delivered out of the deep Waters; let not the Deep ſwallow me up.</hi> And theſe very Petitions im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply what we would prove. Namely, that good
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:34484:69"/> Men may be implunged into Miſeries: into ſuch Floods or Gulphs of Affliction, as they ſhould certainly ſink in, and be irrecoverably drowned; did not GOD in His Mercy interpoſe to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent it. And therefore it is obſervable that the HOLY GHOST marks out the <hi>Righteous</hi> for the moſt <hi>afflicted</hi> ones. <hi>Many are the afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the</hi> Righteous, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 34.19. So that if <hi>others</hi> have Afflictions, the <hi>Righteous</hi> ſhall have <hi>many;</hi> and if <hi>others</hi> have <hi>many</hi> afflictions, <hi>they</hi> ſhall have <hi>many more.</hi> Which made the<note n="*" place="margin">

No Goodneſs privilegeth againſt Sufferings. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictive contingencies are inſeparable Adjuncts of this Life; and none upon Earth can be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empted from them, or exalted above them, be they never ſo rarely and divinely Qualifi'd.

               </p>
               <p>But then it being thus with the <hi>beſt</hi> in this World; for us to have the <hi>Joys</hi> of GOD up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us, to have the <hi>comforts</hi> of Heaven dwelling with us, or abiding in us; muſt be a ſtrangely high and happy Privilege. For tho' the <hi>Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber</hi>
                  <pb n="126" facs="tcp:34484:70"/> of our afflictions <hi>exceed,</hi> and the <hi>Burthen</hi> of them be equal to their multitude; yet theſe moſt heavenly Joys and Comforts, will not fail to ſupport us under them. And at ſuch a rate will they ſupport us, as to render the heavieſt Afflictions that befall us, always <hi>tolerable</hi> and moſtly <hi>eaſy</hi> to us. They'll anoint our Sores, and bind up our Wounds; they'll cool our Heats, and mitigate our Pains; they'll lighten our Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, and leſſen our Miſeries; they'll take out the Sting of our fierceſt Terrours, and rebate the Edge of our keeneſt Troubles; they'll aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwage the Anguiſh of our moſt dolorous Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ladies, and ſweeten our ſharpeſt and bittereſt Adverſities, ſo far as it is requiſite or needful for us.</p>

                  <hi>according to the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of my</hi> Griefs <hi>within my Heart.</hi> And to it the <hi>Vulgar</hi> Tranſlation anſwers. So that by theſe two <hi>Verſions, Thoughts</hi> here, are no other than <hi>Griefs;</hi> and no ſlighty or ſuperficial ones neither: for they reacht the <hi>Heart.</hi> And let none think that reſtleſs turbulent <hi>thoughts</hi> are a light ſort of Miſery. They rack the Mind be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond all things <hi>here,</hi> and are the moſt piercing, terrible, and tormenting Evils that the <hi>next World</hi> hath. And they muſt needs be ſo. For
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:34484:70"/> as they will force the Soul to look <hi>back</hi> continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally upon the pernicious Folly, and amazing Mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of her <hi>paſt ſins;</hi> ſo they will compel her to look <hi>forward</hi> as much, in the black, confound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and intolerable Proſpect of her <hi>endleſs Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments;</hi> the ſad effects of her wretched Exor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitancies. But at preſent we are to note, that the Thoughts mentioned by the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> were very afflicting ones. As they ſprung from great Troubles, ſo they produced ſuch. Nor is the Senſe thus ſet at all too <hi>high;</hi> for the Context indeed does not only <hi>allow,</hi> but alſo <hi>require</hi> it; and the <hi>condition</hi> of GOD's People warrants as much, as that <hi>Pſalm</hi> repreſents it. For, as we find in the Beginning of it, the Church's Enemies were now in the Heighth of their Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph and Tyranny; and ſo its Members under their Inſolence, muſt needs be in lamentable Tribulation and Diſtreſs. How could they be otherwiſe? when theſe inſulting Tyrants did not only <hi>afflict</hi> GOD's <hi>Heritage,</hi> but <hi>break in pieces the People of the</hi> LORD, v. 5. Surely a Prophet, as <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> was, at ſuch a time, and on ſuch an occaſion, could not but be full of <hi>Griefs</hi> as well as Thoughts. But now ſee the Efficacy, the <hi>ſupporting</hi> Efficacy of holy <hi>Comforts.</hi> When his Mind was ground as it were, with vexatious Thoughts, and His Heart oppreſs'd with moſt burthenſome Griefs, and a multitude of both lay very hard and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy upon him: yet <hi>then</hi> did <hi>they</hi> uphold him. Nor did they only inable him to bear up with <hi>Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,</hi> but they produc'd <hi>Delights;</hi> produced De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights in his very <hi>Soul,</hi> notwithſtanding the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy Circumſtances he was in. From whence we may very reaſonably inferr, that when the good Soul is moſt clogg'd with Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings,
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:34484:71"/> or ſunk never ſo deep in Sorrow and Afflictions; ſhe may yet by the counterpoiſe of ſacred Delights (ſuch as divine <hi>Conſolations</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford) be ſuſtained in them, and raiſed above them.</p>
               <p>And as Comforts will ſupport thus under all <hi>common</hi> and <hi>unavoidable</hi> Afflictions, which ſpring up from our corrupt Nature, and are the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved Fruits of divine Juſtice, and of our own Sins; as Infirmities, Diſeaſes, Misfortunes, and the like: ſo under <hi>ſpecial,</hi> and <hi>choſen</hi> Sufferings, as I may call them, they will do no leſs. And therefore as the Apoſtle affirms that GOD comforts us generally <hi>in</hi> all <hi>our Tribulations,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.4; (not only in this or that; not only in ſome, or many, or moſt; but<note n="*" place="margin">

                  <hi>in all Preſſure</hi> or <hi>Affliction:</hi>) ſo he carefully ſignifies in the next Verſe, that if we ſuffer for CHRIST's ſake, we ſhall not only have <hi>Conſolations</hi> to ſupport us, but ſhall have them in <hi>proportion</hi> to the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of our Perſecution.<note n="†" place="margin">v. 5.</note> 
                  <hi>As the Sufferings of</hi> CHRIST <hi>abound in us, ſo our</hi> Conſolation <hi>alſo</hi> aboundeth <hi>by</hi> CHRIST. And therefore when GOD calls us to ſuffer for JESUS, and His heavenly Grace inables us to it; as certainly as He is the occaſion of theſe our Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings, ſo certainly will He be the Author of Comforts to us in them. For the Conſolation ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cruing to ſuch Sufferers, is to come <hi>by</hi> CHRIST. As He hath purchas'd it for them by His Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, ſo He will diſpenſe it to them by His Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence; nor can they be more ſure of any thing which they need. And as ſure they are to have their Comforts <hi>apportion'd</hi> to the <hi>Degrees</hi> of their Sufferings. The delights in their Souls, ſhall be (as was noted even now out of the <hi>Septua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gint)
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:34484:71"/> according to the</hi> multitude of Sorrows <hi>in their Hearts.</hi> Look as our Miſeries increaſe and ſwell, or riſe higher and higher by perſecutive Severities; ſo our Conſolations ſhall keep pace with them, and anſwerably advance to inable us to endure them. This muſt be paſt all manner of doubt, to them that peruſe but St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Words, and have capacity enough to underſtand their Senſe, and Faith enough to believe their Truth. For what can be the meaning of Conſolations abounding in us <hi>by</hi> CHRIST, when Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings abound in us <hi>for</hi> CHRIST; if it be not that <hi>He</hi> for whom we ſuffer, will com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort us from Heaven <hi>when</hi> we ſuffer; and take care that our Comforts ſhall <hi>equal</hi> our Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings?</p>
               <p>Of this we have Examples in the ſacred Writings. For there it is recorded, that Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians <hi>rejoyced with Joy unſpeakable and full of Glory,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.8; when at the ſame time (as the Context aſſures us) they were in <hi>manifold Trials,</hi> and thoſe Trials were <hi>fiery</hi> ones. And obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable it is of the <hi>Macedonian</hi> Churches, that in a<note n="*" place="margin">2 Cor. 8.2.</note> 
                  <hi>great Trial of</hi> Afflictions, they had <hi>abundance of</hi> Joy. The Storms of Perſecution are ſo far from blowing <hi>out</hi> the Saints Comforts, that they rather blow them <hi>up.</hi> And their Joys, like Palm-Trees; then grow higheſt, when heavieſt Weights are hanged upon them.</p>
               <p>And of the ſame thing we have manifeſt Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplifications in Church-hiſtory, and Martyro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logies. For there it is notorious, that good Men ſuffering for Conſcience-ſake, have a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounded with extraordinary Comforts in the midſt of their Extremities. So abounded with extraordinary Comforts, that beſides rendring
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:34484:72"/> them invincibly patient, they have made them more over-joyful and triumphant. Trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant not only <hi>in themſelves,</hi> but <hi>over</hi> their bloody and barbarous <hi>Enemies.</hi> Inſomuch that with nobleſt Courage, and undaunted Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanimity, they have provoked their Perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and defi'd their Tormenters, challenging them both to do their worſt. But when <hi>they</hi> inrag'd with this glorious Diſdain, hurried them immediately to fearful Executions, and reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to plague them with direful Excruciations: alas they wearied <hi>themſelves</hi> more with invent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and inflicting ingenious Cruelties; than they could weary the innocent <hi>Martyrs</hi> with bearing them. And when they had laboured hard in endeavouring to torture them, and ſtriven long to put them to miſery; as to <hi>many</hi> of them it came to juſt nothing: and <hi>ſome</hi> were ſo far from being ſenſible of Pain, that they were tranſported with exquiſite Sweetneſs and Pleaſure. O the Power of celeſtial Comforts! O the over-powring Influence of them! And tho' this cannot be throughly accounted for by<note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Note</hi> V.</note> Philoſophy, as being a wonderful Effect of a ſupernatural Cauſe; yet ſomething may be ſaid in Explication of it that way.</p>
               <p>Let no Good Chriſtians then be ſo puſilla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimous as to <hi>dread</hi> Troubles. They need not fear any manner of Sufferings. Be the Cup of afflictions never ſo bitter; GOD, we ſee hath a way to ſweeten it. He can ſo ſweeten it with <hi>comforts</hi> from Himſelf, as that the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt ſhall drink it off with Patience, and Profit; and not only ſo, but with <hi>Pleaſure</hi> alſo. And as GOD <hi>can</hi> do this, ſo we may hope that He <hi>will</hi> do it. He bids us in effect to <hi>expect</hi> as

If temporal Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments therefore ſlide from under us, and our earthly ſatisfactions run flat and low; let us be of good courage. <hi>Then</hi> is the time when GOD uſually opens the Springs of Conſolation, and makes his People drink liberally of them. And if beſides their <hi>Loſs</hi> of wordly <hi>contentments,</hi> ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging <hi>calamities</hi> break in upon them; He'll af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford them the larger Draughts ſtill, to refreſh and ſupport them. And ſo tho' they be <hi>trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled on every ſide,</hi> they ſhall not be too much <hi>diſtreſſed;</hi> tho' they be <hi>perplexed,</hi> they ſhall not <hi>Deſpair;</hi> tho' they be <hi>perſecuted,</hi> they ſhall not be <hi>forſaken;</hi> tho' they be <hi>caſt down,</hi> they ſhall not be <hi>deſtroyed,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.8, 9. But it may be from Depreſſions into loweſt Miſeries, they ſhall be lifted up to high and rapturous De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights. And as Providence takes care to fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh the Religious with ſtore of Comforts in a <hi>ſtate</hi> of Sufferings; ſo it ſometimes does the ſame, when Afflictions or Perſecutions are <hi>ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching</hi> to them. As ſuch Evils fall <hi>heavy</hi> when they <hi>come,</hi> ſo many times they ſtrike with Terror <hi>before-hand.</hi> Now that we might not be overcome before they encounter us; and be ſo frighted with the proſpect of them, as upon unhandſom Terms, and in unlawful Ways, to run away from them: GOD fluſhes us with celeſtial Joys. And theſe infuſe ſuch courage into us, and ſtrength of Reſolution; as inable us to vanquiſh our own Daſtardlineſs, and help to buoy us up with Chriſtian Forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, under blackeſt Apprehenſions of ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vening Calamities. And thus Comforts are not
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:34484:73"/> only made <hi>Antidotes</hi> againſt <hi>Impatience,</hi> when Miſeries are <hi>upon</hi> us; but <hi>Remedies</hi> againſt <hi>ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morouſneſs,</hi> when they are advancing <hi>towards</hi> us.</p>
               <p>But O the deplorable <hi>Infelicity</hi> of the Unrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous! Who can ſpeak, or who can think rightly what it is, in reference to <hi>Afflictions</hi> which here befall them? In all reaſon <hi>they</hi> muſt have their <hi>Troubles</hi> as well as other Men. Yea, they deſerving <hi>more,</hi> and deſerving <hi>worſe</hi> trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles than others do; both more and worſe may be incident to them. But then when they come, Lord! how ſad muſt their condition be? For be they never ſo many, and never ſo grievous, the poor Creatures muſt bear them all upon their <hi>own</hi> ſhoulders, without the ſupport of Comforts from above. And muſt not this be an hard Task for them? Will they be able duly to perform it? No more than a Man can go on foot <hi>upon the Waters,</hi> or than he can walk about <hi>when his Head is off:</hi> both which Acts, by the<note n="*" place="margin">

               <p>Indeed while the World goes on Sinners ſide, and Life, and Health, and Strength continue; the Comforts of the SPIRIT are little miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and as little minded. They ſupply them to themſelves another way; by trifling Vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and fruitleſs and unlawful Pleaſures and Divertiſements. But when theſe fail them (as they ſhortly will) and nothing ſave Troubles
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:34484:73"/> ſucceed in their room, what will they then do? eſpecially if their Troubles be ſevere and heavy. Then what would they give for Heaven's Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour; or for a lively ſenſe of its refreſhing Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy?

But alas theſe Mercies belong not to <hi>them;</hi> and therefore of all the ſupport they would yield, they muſt be ſadly deſtitute. Is not here unhappineſs more than enough to them that are under it, and ſenſible of it? To languiſh in Miſery, and to look about them for Help, and to ſee that there is but one who can afford it; and then to think they have lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Reaſon to go to Him for it; becauſe He hath no Reaſon at all to give it, for that they their ſelves have put in Barrs againſt it: how cold muſt this needs ſtrike to their Hearts? And what a ruful Aggravation muſt it be of their Sufferings? It behoves us to watch, that we may never fall into ſo woful a Circumſtance; and to pray that all in it may be delivered well out of it; conſidering what mighty ill conſequents attend it. For where uneaſy Thoughts roll up and down inceſſantly, in the Minds of diſtreſſed and hopeleſs Men; the natural Product of them is (too often) Violence to their own Lives. Or if their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Unquietneſs (a diſmal Infelicity) does not provoke them to ſuch a Pitch of Fury; yet then it will not fail to vent it ſelf, in other out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragious ways. That is to ſay, either in diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented and indecent Speeches; or elſe in down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right impious Murmurings; or elſe in hard Say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of GOD, or hideous Blaſphemies againſt
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:34484:74"/> Him. And thus their ill Caſe will be made much worſe, while increaſe of their Sins re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moves them farther from GOD's Pity.</p>
               <p>But then (which is the Scope at which this aims) <hi>Comforts</hi> in Affliction muſt be uſeful Things; and as many as injoy them muſt be <hi>bleſſed</hi> Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.

How</hi> divine Comforts do <hi>that.</hi>
                  </p>
               </argument>
               <p>THat this Life is a ſtate of <hi>Temptations,</hi> none can doubt, that have been in it long e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to make the Experiment; and have ſo wiſely conſidered things, and convers'd with themſelves, as to obſerve what Occaſions and Incentives to Sin, there are <hi>within,</hi> and <hi>without</hi> them.</p>
               <p>If we look <hi>into</hi> our ſelves we ſhall ſee a great many. Such are the Weakneſs and Erroneouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of our Underſtandings; the Crookedneſs and Perverſeneſs of our Wills; the Eagerneſs and Petulance of our Deſires; the Vanity and Looſeneſs of our Imaginations; the Furiouſneſs and Turbulency of our Paſſions; the Unruli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Greedineſs of our Appetites; the Open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Unwarineſs, and Wildneſs of our Senſes. Oh how ready are all theſe, and that at all times, to prompt us to Folly, and betray us to Impiety! To ſay nothing of the ſly and crafty Inſinuations; or thoſe ſecret Methods, and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Workings, whereby moſt ſubtil and mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious <hi>Spirits,</hi> our mortal Enemies, are often tam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pering with our treacherous Faculties, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veigle and ſeduce us.</p>
               <pb n="136" facs="tcp:34484:75"/>
               <p>And then if we turn our Eyes the <hi>other way,</hi> and from looking <hi>into</hi> our ſelves, look <hi>round about</hi> us; what allurements to Vice muſt fall under our View? and what a multitude of Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions will make up the Proſpect? Yea, what can we ſee, I had almoſt ſaid, <hi>beſides</hi> Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions? For the Food that we eat, and the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quors that we drink; The Clothes that we wear, and the Ornaments that we put on; The Houſes that we dwell in, and the Beds that we ly upon; The Books that we peruſe, and the Company that we converſe with; The Sports that recre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate us, and the Callings that we live by; The Fatigue of our Imployments, and the want of Buſineſs; The Streightneſs of our Fortune, and the Plenty of our Condition; The Solitude of ſingle Life, and the Troubles of Marriage; The Tumults of War, and the Tranquility of Peace; The Eaſe of Liberty, and the Irkſomneſs of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finement; The Deliciouſneſs of Pleaſure, and the Acerbity of Pain; The Vigour of Youth, and the Infirmities of Age; The Comelineſs of Beauty, and the Blemiſhes of Deformity; The Credit of Applauſe, and the Shame of Diſgrace; The Brightneſs of Honour, and the Cloudineſs of Contempt; The Nimbleneſs of Parts, and the Dulneſs of Capacity; The Light of Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and the Darkneſs of Ignorance; The Reſpect of Friends, and the Affronts of Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies: are all apt to <hi>tempt</hi> us, and if we be not vigilant, able to overcome us. In ſhort; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt any thing we can name, or every thing we can think of; be it never ſo great, or never ſo little; never ſo vile, or never ſo valuable; never ſo uſeleſs, or never ſo profitable: at ſome time, in ſome place, and in ſome circumſtance
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:34484:75"/> or other, either <hi>is,</hi> or <hi>may</hi> be a <hi>Temptation</hi> to us. And therefore the Son of <hi>Sirach</hi> gives general Warning to all that intend to be Religious, to expect Temptations, and provide againſt them. <hi>My Son, if thou come to ſerve the</hi> LORD, <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare thy Soul for Temptations, Ecclus.</hi> 2.1. And moſt aſſuredly there is great need of doing it, they are ſo numerous.</p>
               <p>The <hi>beſt</hi> of Men have had the trueſt and deepieſt ſenſe of this. Let St. <hi>Bernard</hi> ſpeak for one.<note n="*" place="margin">Hei mihi quia undi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que tela volant, undique tentamenta: quocunque me vertam nulla ſecuritas eſt. Meditat. Cap. 12.</note> 
                  <hi>Alas for me, becauſe I ſee Warrs on every ſide; on every ſide Darts, on every ſide Temptations</hi> fly; <hi>and which way ſoever I turn my ſelf, there is no ſecurity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>St. <hi>Jerome</hi> alſo is an authentic Witneſs in the Caſe. For when he fled the common Society of Men, and betook himſelf to a ſolitary and aſcetic Life; when he wandred in Deſerts, and prayed upon Mountains, and made himſelf a Companion of Scorpions, and wild Beaſts; when he macerated his Fleſh with holy Severi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and extenuated his Body by religious Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline, and the Arts of a ſtrict and auſtere Mortification; on purpoſe to avoid Satanical Suggeſtions, and to check and ſuppreſs the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities of Sin: even <hi>then</hi> they came in very fiercely upon him, and aſſaulted him with ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ribleſt Fury and Violence, as he complains to<note n="†" place="margin">Epiſt. 22.</note> 
                  <hi>Euſtochium.</hi> And which might ſeem incredible (if he had not piouſly and gravely ſaid it) he tells her, that in the vaſt and horrid<note n="‖" place="margin">O quoties ego ipſe in eremo conſtitutus, &amp; in illa vaſta ſolitudine quae exuſta Solis ardori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus, horridum praeſtat Monachis habitaculum, putabam me Romanis intereſſe deliciis.</note> Wilderneſs, he
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:34484:76"/> met with as ſtrong and perilous Temptations, as if he had been in the City of <hi>Rome.</hi> Strange to think! that ſuch dangerous Allurements ſhould dwell in ſo much Solitude. But ſo long as the World is full of Devils, and the Heart of Man is full of Corruptions; no wonder that a Deſart ſhould he full of Temptations. And as one ſign that Temptations are ſtrongeſt <hi>there,</hi> the Scene of our SAVIOUR's Firſt Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was a <hi>Wilderneſs.</hi> Where the Tempter would never have ſet upon him, but that he knew it would make for his own Advantage. And in this Reſpect it conduceth much to it; that all things there are quiet and ſtill. So that if the Tempter deſigns to move the <hi>ſenſes,</hi> he may make thoſe external Pictures or Images (by which he would prevail, and ſet them to work upon the Mind) the more lively and enticing: as having nothing to diſturb him in painting them out, and ſetting them off, in their beſt Figures and Colours. And in caſe he intends a cloſer Attaque, and ſlier Application; that is, to take the Mind by the help of the <hi>Fancy:</hi> he hath then the better opportunity not only to form inward Illuſions for his Purpoſe, and to make them more fine and inviting to the <hi>Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination,</hi> (by which he would fain debauch the Judgment;) but alſo to hold the Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion (by which he ſtrives to corrupt the Underſtanding) more cloſe and fixt to the Deluſions he repreſents. For where there is Solitarineſs, there is little to divert. For theſe Reaſons it was, that Satan might chuſe to ſhow CHRIST the Kingdoms of the World alſo, and the Glory of them, in a

               <p>Let but one more, inſtead of many, atteſt the Truth, which is here upon Proof. I mean, St. <hi>Auſtin,</hi> whom I take to be as good and holy a Man, as any that ever liv'd ſince his Time. His Teſtimony lies in theſe Words.<note n="*" place="margin">Quis pertinens ad Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtum, non variis tentatio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibus agitatur?

Omnibus modis inſtat Diabolus quemadmodum dejiciat. <hi>In Pſal.</hi> 62.</note> 
                  <hi>Who that belongs to</hi> CHRIST, <hi>is not vexed with va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Temptations? The Devil and his Angels do every day diſquiet him, that ſo by one Luſt or other, by one Suggeſtion or other, he may be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted or turned aſide. Either by the
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:34484:77"/> Promiſe of Gain, or by the Fear of Loſs; by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of Life, or by the Dread of Death; by the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, or by the Friendſhip of the Great and Mighty. The Devil is urgent by all manner of means to foil the Chriſtian, or to caſt him down.</hi> So that from all hands we learn, that with Solicitations to Evil, we muſt be infeſted, while we are upon Earth.</p>
               <p>But then when Chriſtians are beſet with ſuch Throngs, and begirt with ſuch Armies of peſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Temptations; when there are ſo many <hi>within</hi> them, and ſo many <hi>without</hi> them; and abundance of malignant and mighty Spirits to manage both, and with the utmoſt Cunning and Dexterity, to ſet them home upon them, that they might be worſted by them; and there is no way for them to ſhift or decline them: muſt not theſe Chriſtians be in a pitiable caſe? For as to ſtand will be moſt difficult for them, ſo to fall will be as dangerous. Nor can they be ſecure that they ſhall not fall from any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herent Abilities of their own. Alas they are but Fleſh and Blood; and were they to conteſt but their own perverſe Nature, and others that partake of it, and are like themſelves; they would ſo have Task enough upon them. But then beſides this, they are to<note n="*" place="margin">Eph. 6<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>12.</note>

               <p>But therefore here again divine <hi>Comforts</hi> exert their Strength, and ſhow themſelves to be things of <hi>Bleſſed</hi> Uſe. For by their heavenly Power they do ſo corroborate tempted ſtruggling Souls,
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:34484:77"/> as to inable them to hold out in their Noble Agonies, or Spiritual Conflicts. So that as many as are under the Influence of <hi>them</hi> are out of the reach of the Devil's Shafts. Whatever Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows he levels at them, or lets fly againſt them, are ſure either never to hit them, or not to hurt them. For their <hi>Comforts</hi> within do ſo ſhield them from the Malice and Miſchief of Hell, as to render them invulnerable by its worſt ſpite and violence. A Chriſtian tempted in the midſt of Conſolations, ſtands like a Rock in the midſt of the Sea. He may be beaten on every ſide with boiſterous Waves, but the ſurly Billows that daſh againſt him, do only break themſelves to pieces, while he ſtill remains ſteddy and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moveable.</p>
               <p>They who write of <hi>Gemms</hi> and precious Stones, tell us that many of them are of ſingular Virtue, againſt the <hi>Plague</hi> and <hi>Poiſons.</hi> And for this,<note n="*" place="margin">Anſel. Boet. Hiſt. Gem. lib. 2. cap. 43.</note> the <hi>Sapphire,</hi>

Yet we need not doubt, but heavenly Comforts are more ſovereign Antidotes, and effectual Amulets, againſt Satan's peſtilent and poiſonous Injections. They ſo fortify the Souls, where they dwell, as to render them Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion-proof.</p>
               <p>Nor is it hard to conceive <hi>how</hi> they do it. For all the hold that Temptations can lay upon thoſe where they faſten, is by the <hi>Enticement</hi> of ſome flattering <hi>Pleaſures,</hi> wherewith they offer to entertain and gratify them. So that could but their Minds be ſet <hi>againſt</hi> thoſe Pleaſures, or any way drawn <hi>off</hi> from lingring after them; the Temptations would immediately be broken vanquiſht, and the Parties urged and ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:34484:78"/> by them, moſt happily ſecured. Now this Kindneſs divine <hi>Comforts</hi> do us, when Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions aſſault us. They daſh them to pieces, or help us to do it, by diluting or deadning the Pleaſures which they proffer. And <hi>that</hi> they do, by out-ſhooting Temptations, as I may ſay, in their own Bow; or by producing <hi>higher</hi> Pleaſures in us, than any that <hi>they</hi> can allure us with. For when two ſorts of Pleaſures are tendred to us, common ſenſe will incline us to the <hi>ſweeteſt.</hi> And look how far one ſort <hi>excells</hi> the other and ſo far it recommends it ſelf more <hi>forcibly</hi> to our choice; tho' at the ſame time it diminiſhes our Eſtimate of the <hi>other,</hi> and cauſes us to deſpiſe it as inferior to it: and the more for thruſting it ſelf into competition with that ſweeter pleaſure. Now when Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptations court us, tho' they bring <hi>pleaſures</hi> with them to recommend them; yet if <hi>comforts</hi> ſtrike in at the ſame Juncture, they will come attended with ſo much <hi>nobler</hi> and <hi>ſweeter</hi> Pleaſures; that thoſe of Sin which gild the Temptation, or ſet it off, will be <hi>nothing</hi> to them. For be they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo high, <hi>theſe</hi> will far ſurmount them; be they never ſo ſweet, <hi>theſe</hi> will far out-vie them. And therefore for us to cloſe with <hi>them,</hi> and to reject <hi>theſe;</hi> would be to go againſt inward Senſe, as well as againſt Reaſon: and to prove our ſelves ſtupid, as well as inconſiderate. Whence it will follow, that if <hi>Comforts</hi> and <hi>Temptations</hi> chance to be co-incident, or to come together; we muſt as certainly refuſe the Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of the <hi>latter,</hi> for the Pleaſures of the <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,</hi> and ſo by reſiſting, bring the Power of Temptations to a ſtand; it is impoſſible but People in their right Wits, muſt preferr Gold
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:34484:78"/> before Dirt. As it is impoſſible but Chriſtians,<note n="*" place="margin">Heb. 5.14.</note> 
                  <hi>who have their ſenſes exerciſed to diſcern Good and Evil,</hi> muſt preferr Life before Death; and the ſolid vital Delights of Heaven, before the frothy, deadly, and damnable Complacencies, of lewd, and vile, and vitious Satisfactions.</p>
               <p>And if Comforts do not always <hi>keep Time</hi> with Temptations, yet <hi>that</hi> will not hinder them from ſtrengthening us againſt them. For as when they come <hi>before</hi> them, they fortify us in way of Preparative; ſo when they <hi>follow</hi> them, they fortify us, againſt others, yet to come, by recompencing our Conſtancy in thoſe already paſt.</p>
               <p>To what hath been ſaid, we may add; that theſe ſacred Comforts do not baffle Temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and ſink them only by their own <hi>proper</hi> Weight; but alſo as they help us to look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and inable us to form fair and lovely Idea's of thoſe Superlative <hi>Joys</hi> and Conſolati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons <hi>above.</hi> The Man that never beheld the glorious Sun, will know the better what to make of it, if he ſees but the twinkling Stars. And the viewing and ſounding ſome large and deep Lake, will help us to conceive what the Ocean is. So from the holy Comforts we feel in this Life, we may argue and conclude what ſhall be in the next. And if our <hi>preſent</hi> Comforts can convince us that there are <hi>more</hi> and <hi>better</hi> to come; and our preſent Capacity of injoying theſe Comforts, can alſo convince us that <hi>better</hi> Capacities of injoying better Comforts, are now dormant in us, and ſhall at laſt be awakened and drawn forth into Action (than which no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can be more probable:) then theſe Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts which we have, as they point out others
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:34484:79"/> which are ours in Expectancy and Reſerve; muſt ſtrengthen us more againſt Temptations ſtill. For when the ſingle Pleaſures of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts we poſſeſs; can ſwallow up the biggeſt unlawful Pleaſures that can tempt us; then when they open us a Window into Heaven, as it were, and back their <hi>own</hi> Force, with the Proſpect of <hi>others</hi> much beyond themſelves; the ſight of thoſe Comforts in Reverſion, together with the ſweetneſs of theſe in our Fruition, cannot but double our Courage againſt Temptations. Be they never ſo preſſing and importunate, here's enough methinks to make us ſo inflexible to them, that even Stiffneſs it ſelf ſhould bend and yield ſooner than we. Will not this be a moſt bleſſed Circumſtance? Yet thus <hi>Bleſſed,</hi> thus really and highly Bleſſed ſhalt Thou be, if thou wilt but make <hi>one</hi> amongſt Holy <hi>Mourners.</hi> For they that mourn, ſhall aſſuredly be comforted, and Comforts will fortify againſt all Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>

               <p>THO' Good Men differ greatly from others, in regard of their Principles and their Practices, their Perfections and their Privileges; yet they are made of the ſame <hi>Matter,</hi> and ſo muſt conſiſt of the ſame <hi>Nature,</hi> and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently muſt be liable to the ſame <hi>Deſtiny</hi> with the Reſt.

<pb n="146" facs="tcp:34484:80"/> it, and they fear to <hi>view</hi> it at a diſtance: but when it approaches them they faint, and ſink, and are amazed and aſtoniſhed. Nor can I blame them for being ſo over-powred with Dread. For as Death is their Enemy, ſo when it comes, GOD knows, 'tis to do them a ſad Office. To rend their immortal Souls from their Bodies, and to hale them out into the eternal State. And there we believe but <hi>two</hi> Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of abode, Heaven, and Hell. For the <hi>firſt,</hi> they are unfit; and for the <hi>ſecond,</hi> how ſhall they endure it?

               <p>But here again divine <hi>Comforts</hi> ſhew them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to be moſt <hi>bleſſed</hi> things, and that very eminently and conſpicuouſly. For where theſe Fears are full-grown, as I may ſay, and run up to the higheſt Pitch that they can reach to, in pious Souls: holy Comforts are able to expel them. Such is their Force, that they no ſooner enter the religious Heart, but they immediately quell all Fears of Death in it, or in a great mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure exterminate them out of it. Nor are they only able to damp the Terrors of Death <hi>in</hi> us, or effectually to aboliſh or drive them <hi>out</hi> of us; but to turn thoſe Terrors into real Triumphs and Tranſports of Mind, accompani'd with high and heavenly Delights. Let none take theſe for loud Words only, or think that they are ſpoken meerly at random. Many righteous Souls departing this Life (as ſubject to Infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:34484:81"/> and Fears as <hi>we</hi>) have ſealed them up for certain Truths, by very remarkable experimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Teſtimony. For by ſeaſonable Influxes of theſe mighty <hi>Comforts,</hi> they have not only had their Fears ſuppreſs'd, or chaſed from them; but their Spirits ſo raviſht at their dying hour, that they have been forc'd to give vent to their rap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turous Pleaſures, and delightful Paſſions, in ſtrange and amazing Exclamations. In ſuch exalted and ſurprizing Strains, as have not only ſweetly affected, but even aſtoniſht all thoſe about them.</p>

               <p>And memorable it is of <hi>Severinus</hi> the <hi>Indian</hi> Saint, that GOD, in his laſt Sickneſs, did ſo repleniſh him with holy Conſolations, that he earneſtly beſought him either to take him pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently out of the World, or to ſtay his divine Joys from deſcending ſo freely and exuberantly upon him. Leſt if he out-liv'd them, he ſhould be miſerable through the want of them, when they were withdrawn: and the more miſerable for having drunk ſo <hi>deep</hi> of their abounding Sweetneſs.</p>
               <p>Now in the midſt of ſuch bleſſed <hi>Comforts</hi> what <hi>Fear,</hi> even of Death it ſelf, can faſten upon us? The Pleaſures of <hi>them</hi> do ſo power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully divert our Minds, and delight our Souls that we can neither attend to any formidable Objects, nor becapable of afflictive Impreſſions
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:34484:82"/> from them. They give us ſuch a lively and overcoming ſenſe of GOD's Love to us, of His Care of us, of His Protection over us, and of the ſtrange Felicities He hath provided for us, and is putting into our eternal Poſſeſſion; as quite bears down, and perfectly ſwallows up all manner of Dread. So that in theſe circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances we are not only free from Fear, but im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible it is that we ſhould be touched with it, while <hi>they</hi> continue. Where Souls ſwim in ſuch a Deluge of Comforts, their Fears muſt be drowned in the Inundation.</p>
               <p>It is a great Word which the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> ſpeaks, and very ſignificant as to our purpoſe.<note n="*" place="margin">Pſal. 37.37</note> 
                  <hi>Keep innocency, and take heed to the thing that is right;</hi> or, <hi>Mark the perfect Man, and behold the upright;</hi> (the Original may be rendred either way) <hi>for the End of that Man is Peace.</hi> There's the good Man's Felicity. Whatever Troubles or Tumults, Diſquietments or Uneaſineſſes, Toſſings or Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors he meets with in the Beginning, or Progreſs of his Life; yet before it comes to its final Period, in all likelihood he is ſure of Peace. Of <hi>Proſperity,</hi> that is, for ſame time before he goes hence, (if beſt for him) and of <hi>Comfort</hi> at the hour of his Departure. Thus (as <hi>David</hi> noted) it was in <hi>his</hi> Days; and ſo perhaps, we may ſee it to be in <hi>ours,</hi> if we take but due Care and Pains to obſerve it.</p>
               <p>With the <hi>unrighteous</hi> Perſon it is quite other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe. He lives in frequent Feuds with himſelf and is ſeldom at quiet for Frays with his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience. <hi>That</hi> checks, and twitches, and gripes him at every turn. If he flouriſhes in the World, Guilt within dulls his Happineſs, and makes it inſipid; yea, imbitters the ſame, and makes it
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:34484:82"/> unſavoury. And in caſe he declines or falls un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Misfortunes; the ſame Guilt aggravates and inrages his Miſeries. It adds extreamly to the weight of his Calamities, and ſets ſo terrible an Edge upon them, as makes them to cut more deeply and direfully. And as the Guilt which Impious Men have contracted, tortures them thus wofully while they <hi>live;</hi> ſo it racks them a thouſand, ten thouſand times worſe, when they come to <hi>die,</hi> if they be not <hi>ſenſeleſs</hi> of their ſad condition.</p>
               <p>Then quick Apprehenſions of the Juſtice of GOD, and of their own unworthineſs, break in upon them. And being once entred, they ſtartle their Minds, and they awaken their Souls that before perhaps ſlept ſecurely in ſin and dreamt of nothing but Eaſe and Pleaſure. And the ſame Apprehenſions that rowze them out of their wretched Security, help them to form right Notions of Death. They tell them plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and they tell them truly what it muſt be to their unprepared Spirits. Namely, a Meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of Wrath, and an Inſtrument of Vengeance, and a ſad Conſignation to endleſs Torments. A terrible Breach which the divine Anger makes upon them, whereat Condemnation, and their Ruine enter. When GOD ſummons them from hence out of the Body, they can think no other, than that 'tis to ſend them directly to Hell; and to confine them for ever to the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions of Darkneſs and the Priſons of Sorrow, and the curſed Habitations of rebellious Sinners. And when once they are convinc'd that their Paſſage hence, is a Deſcent to everlaſting Plagues and Miſeries; how muſt they <hi>fear,</hi> and what Horrors will ſeize them, when they
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:34484:83"/> feel it approaching? As the<note n="*" place="margin">De Serres.</note> 
                  <hi>Hiſtorian</hi> relates concerning <hi>Lewis</hi> the Eleventh of <hi>France,</hi> when he drew on a pace to his Diſſolution, he ſtrictly charged all about him, that they ſhould not ſo much as <hi>mention</hi> that <hi>cruel</hi> Word, <hi>Death,</hi> to him. And no wonder that from the aforeſaid con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction, ſuch exceſſive Fear ſhould ariſe to ſuch as die impenitent. For when Men perceive, that they are ſinking down into the bottomleſs Depths of eternal Sufferings; how can they chuſe but be lamentably overwhelmed with ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging Horrors?</p>
               <p>Nor does the amazing Proſpect of this diſmal Calamity, overſet Men with <hi>Fears</hi> only, at their laſt Hour; but hurries them on to other <hi>Expreſſions</hi> of their Aſtoniſhing Troubles. For when they feel they muſt die, and that Death will convey them to interminable Puniſhments; then, poor Souls! they ſigh and lament. Then they ring their Hands, and they tear their Hair, and they curſe the Day that ever they were born to be ſo unhappy. Then they ſigh when they are awake, and they ſtart in their ſleep, and are continually frighted with ſuch inward Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors, that they would gladly run away even from themſelves, if ſo be they did know but <hi>how,</hi> and <hi>whither.</hi> Then they call for Eaſe, but they cannot have it; they ſeek for Reſt, but they cannot find it: and therefore burſting out into doleful Tears (in the heighth of bitter, but fruitleſs Paſſion) to thoſe about them, they make either this, or the like heavy complaint. Now we are undone: O wretched Creatures! we are loſt for ever. We might have been ſaved if we would, and we verily thought we ſhould have been ſo; but alas we find that we were
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:34484:83"/> greatly deceived. For our Hopes are now gone, and our Confidence is quite ſunk; we are lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the World, and GOD hath left <hi>us;</hi> and who can relieve whom He rejects? Once we were offered Peace and Love, and might have had them both upon eaſy Terms. But thoſe bleſſed Tenders are now over, and the Hand that kindly reach'd them towards us, is armed with Rage, and ſtretcht out with fierce Indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation againſt us. Oh the precious Hours that we imbezilled! the ſweet Opportunities that we neglected! the gracious Invitations that we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed! the holy Motions that we reſiſted! the heavenly Glories that we deſpiſed! Fooliſh, raſh, and ſenſeleſs Creatures that we were to do it! O that we might but <hi>repeat</hi> our Lives; that we might injoy theſe Mercies but <hi>once</hi> again. But here's the thing that breaks our Hearts, we know that this ſhall never be. Our Time is ſpent, and Grace is paſt; the LORD is juſt, and we muſt periſh.</p>
               <p>Such are the Wailings of hopleſs Sinners; and in ſuch mournful Strains as theſe, they ſometimes relate their Death-bed Miſeries. And let none blame them as if they were <hi>too querul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous</hi> at ſuch a time; they have cauſe enough for the Complaints they make. Yea, when in bittereſt Words, and loudeſt Out-cries they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs their Grief; they rate the Accents of it too low; their Sorrow is bigger than their La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation. Grant, O GOD, of Mercies, we beſeech thee, that we may never fall under the one, and never have occaſion to take up the other.</p>
               <p>Of all the ſad Spectacles in the whole World, I think none more lamentable, than to ſee a
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:34484:84"/> wicked Man upon his Death-Bed. To ſee how the nearer he draws to dying, the more afraid ſtill, he is to do it, becauſe he is unfit. With what terrible Anguiſh muſt this Fear of his needs ſting his Soul? and how intolerable muſt that Anguiſh be, becauſe it is incurable? Yea, the truth is, in reference to the ungodly, Death is armed with a <hi>double ſting; before</hi> it comes, it ſtrikes them with the Sting of woful Horror; when <hi>paſt,</hi> with that of curſed Miſery; Death to them is but an Inlet into Hell, that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Miſery; where Sorrow reigns without Meaſure or End. And as they that are <hi>in</hi> this miſerable ſtate, cannot but languiſh in grievous Tortures; ſo they that feel themſelves haſting <hi>to</hi> it, cannot but lie under as grievous Fears.</p>
               <p>But now when the <hi>righteous</hi> go from hence, they do it in far more eaſy circumſtances, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they do it in a better condition. They profeſs themſelves ſtrangers here upon Earth, and they ſeek a City that hath Foundations in Heaven: And as they have wiſely laid up their Treaſure there, ſo their Hearts are with it al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready; which makes <hi>them</hi> very willing to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low. When their Turns come, they never re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pine or quarrel at their Deſtiny; nor lament the caſe of their diſlodging Souls: but lie down contentedly at the Feet of Providence, and are really pleas'd that they have <hi>leave</hi> to be gone. And one good Help to make them ſo, is the <hi>Sweetneſs</hi> of their Paſſage. Their uprightneſs (according to the Royal Pſalmiſt) brings them <hi>Peace at the laſt.</hi> And that Peace keeps all thoſe Thorns out of their Death-bed Pillows, or elſe plucks them thence, which prick and gall un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly Wretches, and make their Heads to lie
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:34484:84"/> uneaſy. And when that is done, inſtead of theſe Thorns, it wreaths <hi>Olive</hi> Branches about their Temples; fills them with Tranquillity and holy Quietneſs. And then though Death comes never ſo ſuddenly, and though when it comes, it ſtrikes never ſo furiouſly, its fierceſt Blow cannot make them unhappy. They can bear it compoſedly, and without Fear; becauſe they can do it comfortably, and without Danger.</p>
               <p>It was a noble piece of courage which <hi>David</hi> put on, and a gallant Reſolution, worthy of himſelf, which he bravely took up, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 23.4. <hi>Though I walk through the valley of the ſhadow of Death, I will fear no evil.</hi> But whence did it ſpring? or what was the Baſis upon which it ſtood? Not his <hi>Puiſſance,</hi> though he was a mighty Prince; not his <hi>Magnanimity,</hi> though he was an Heroe of a great Mind: but <hi>Divine Comforts. They</hi> were the bleſſed and generous Stock, which bare this excellent and deſirable Fruit. So the following words inform us; <hi>for Thou art with me, Thy Rod, and thy Staff they ſhall comfort me.</hi> Whence it is plain, that GOD's Preſence, and his ſupporting <hi>Conſolations,</hi> were the Grounds of the good Man's confidence and courage. And truly as many as are happy in <hi>thoſe,</hi> though they be in the valley of the Sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of Death, muſt needs be above all <hi>fear</hi> of dying. For, for ſuch to dye, is but to ſtep out of one Heaven, into another: and can the fearfulleſt in the World be afraid to do that? Whenever we draw near to the Gates of Death, if GOD be but with us; if the Rod of His Power does but protect us, and the Staff of His <hi>Comforts</hi> does but ſuſtain us: we are as ſure to be free from diſtracting Terrors, as they that
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:34484:85"/> are deſtitute of thoſe Encouragements, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy of them; are ſure to be full of them, at ſuch a Time, if they be themſelves, and think what they are about to Suffer.</p>
               <p>And let none ſurmiſe (as ſome perhaps may be ready to do) that divine Comforts (thoſe Cordials from Heaven) may be too <hi>weak</hi> or languid things to ſupport them under their Death-bed Terrors. For be their Illneſs never ſo great, and be their Miſeries never ſo many, and be their Pains and Agonies never ſo ſtrong, and never ſo weariſome; Yea, be their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition as ſad and deplorable, as violent Sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, or approaching Death are able to make it; and ſo their Fear as high as dying Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances can poſſibly raiſe it: yet if GOD will but pleaſe to be merciful to them, if He will but graciouſly condeſcend to viſit them, if He will but look down and ſmile upon them, or (as we read in the<note n="*" place="margin">Chap. 1. 2. 2. 6.</note> 
                  <hi>Canticles) fall upon their Necks, and Kiſs and Embrace them:</hi> all their fears will leave them in a Moment. And no wonder that the Comforts which iſſue from the Face and Favour of GOD, ſhould immediately chaſe away the Fears of Death; when they would do no leſs by the Pains of Hell, were they ſhed down upon the blackeſt Spirit that ſuffers the worſt, or extreameſt of them. But alas his ruful unfitneſs for them, and incapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of receiving them, will for ever bar, and hinder the Experiment.</p>
               <p>Nor will holy Comforts only <hi>expell</hi> good Peoples <hi>Fears</hi> of Death, and turn them into noble <hi>courage</hi> againſt it; but they often im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove their Courage into pious <hi>Deſires</hi> of it. This is diſcoverable from ſeveral Texts of
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:34484:85"/> Scripture. So we find <hi>Rev.</hi> 22.17. that <hi>the</hi> SPIRIT <hi>and the Bride ſay, Come.</hi> The true Church of GOD, being influenc'd by His SPIRIT (for in the words there is an <hi>Hendiadis,</hi> one thing expreſs'd by two) does <hi>beg</hi> CHRIST's Second Coming, His coming to Judgment. And they who deſire that Advent of His, muſt alſo implicitly deſire to <hi>Dye:</hi> becauſe whenever it comes, if they be alive, it brings upon them a Change <hi>equivalent</hi> to Death. And S. <hi>Peter</hi> tells the Chriſtians of his time, that they ſhould not only be <hi>looking for,</hi> but <hi>haſting unto the coming of the Day of</hi> GOD, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.12. or rather,<note n="†" place="margin">

Whom have I in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven but Thee, and there is none upon Earth that I deſire beſides Thee,</hi> ſaid <hi>Aſaph, Pſal.</hi> 73.25. And when he deſired GOD ſo much, he could not chuſe but deſire to <hi>dye,</hi> that he might come to the <hi>full</hi> and moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable <hi>Enjoyment</hi> of Him. Eſpecially when he apprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him to be the <hi>Strength of</hi> his failing <hi>Fleſh,</hi> and <hi>Heart;</hi> and his <hi>Portion for ever:</hi> as it appears he did, in the following Verſe. <hi>Like as the Hart panteth after the Water-brooks, ſo longeth my Soul after Thee,</hi> O GOD. <hi>My Soul is athirſt for</hi> GOD, <hi>yea, even for the living</hi> GOD; <hi>when ſhall I come to appear before the
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:34484:86"/> Preſence of</hi> GOD? <hi>Pſal.</hi> 42.1, 2. Which pathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic Expreſſions, tho' in their primary Aſpect, they look to GOD's <hi>Preſence</hi> in the <hi>Sanctua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry;</hi> yet they may extend to His <hi>Preſence</hi> in <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven</hi> as well. And ſo they ſhow the vehement<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly tranſported Paſſions, of a Soul raviſh'd with Comforts from GOD; and languiſhing with eager and importunate <hi>Deſires</hi> of the Body's Diſſolution, that ſo ſhe might be carri'd up hence, to an everlaſting Participation of more of thoſe Comforts.</p>
               <p>And therefore here we muſt note, that none deſire <hi>Death</hi> merely for <hi>it ſelf;</hi> nor can they in reaſon do it, as being deſtructive to their Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. For the Nature of Man, we know, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts in the <hi>Vital Union</hi> of Soul and Body. But Death <hi>divides</hi> theſe two, and very rudely <hi>tears</hi> them aſunder. And who can deſire ſuch contra-natural Violence ſhould ever befal them for its <hi>own ſake?</hi> a Violence that <hi>ſeparates</hi> thoſe eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Principles, whereof they are compounded, and ſo brings with it the preſent <hi>Ruin</hi> of their Perſons. The Law of <hi>Self-preſervation</hi> in the animate World is univerſal; and ſo muſt be in force among <hi>Rational</hi> Beings, and can never be rooted out where Humanity grows. For <hi>us</hi> therefore to deſire what is fatal to us, merely for its ſelf; muſt be nothing leſs than to put off our own Nature, and to be what we are not, even while we continue what we are: which is perfect nonſenſe, and manifeſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction; and a thing moſt unpracticable, becauſe impoſſible. And then beſides, there is a farther malignity in Death, which makes it that it cannot be deſirable for its ſelf. For it is not only an enemy to Man, as it demoliſhes
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:34484:87"/> his Body, and breaks his vital Frame to pieces; but alſo as it contains <hi>malediction</hi> in it. For it is the curſed fruit of <hi>Adam</hi>'s ſin; and ſo car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries with it the bitterneſs of a <hi>penal</hi> ſeverity; it being juſtly inflicted as a puniſhment of Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience.</p>
               <p>But tho' none can deſire Death for <hi>it ſelf,</hi> yet we may deſire it upon <hi>other</hi> Accounts, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly upon account of Divine Comforts. And here let me add, theſe Deſires<note n="*" place="margin">Note, that what follows is ſpoken only of <hi>eminent Chriſtians;</hi> and but of <hi>ſome</hi> of them nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</note>, in ſome <hi>eminent</hi> Chriſtians, are ſtrangely vehement and importunate. They grow ſo high, and they run ſo ſtrong, that they are fain to give vent to them in Solemn Expreſſions. For ſometimes they ſigh, and ſometimes they weep, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times they are ready to fret and be half diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented; and ſometimes to repine and be holily impatient, that they cannot dye. They are fit to cry out, and that very often, O Death where art thou thus long? Why comeſt thou ſo ſlowly? Mend thy pace and make more haſte; that ſo thine hand which others fear, may lead my weary Soul to Heaven.</p>
               <p>They wonder what ſhift thoſe famous Men made, who liv'd ſo long in the <hi>Primitive</hi> World: and ſhould <hi>they</hi> be condemned to the Like Abode upon Earth, they would think it an hard and moſt cruel Sentence. They rejoice exceedingly upon their own account, that the Life of Man is ſo very much ſhortned: and next to the Mercy of dying at all, they reckon it a choice one that they dye ſo <hi>ſoon.</hi> And as ſhort as the Thread of Life is now made, they grudge it ſhould run out to its utmoſt Length; but are willing rather to have it cut off betimes, that ſo they may be happy in a ſpeedier Diſmiſſion.</p>
               <pb n="161" facs="tcp:34484:87"/>
               <p>Whereas <hi>others</hi> quarrel with Time for its <hi>Swiftneſs,</hi> and angrily wiſh, that its Wings were clipt for flying ſo faſt: <hi>they</hi> cry out 'tis <hi>ſlow,</hi> and blame it that it does not mend its Pace. For if they muſt be old before they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part, they would be ſo quickly, that they might the ſooner be gone. They hope for Death every Year, they look for it every Month, and they long for it every Day. If they envy not the Saints that dye young, they are hugely pleas'd with their happy Lot; and had it been in their choice, how very contentedly would they have been of their Number?</p>
               <p>So very <hi>deſirous</hi> are they to dye, that they can ſcarce hear of one deſperately Sick; but they are ready to grieve that it is not their caſe. So very deſirous are they to dye, that when they hear of one dead, or ſee him carri'd to his Grave; they are ready to cry out, O that I had gone in <hi>his</hi> ſtead, and that he had ſtaid in <hi>my</hi> Room. So very deſirous are they to dye, that high Diſtempers do but chear their Spirits; and tho' through weakneſs of Body, their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance may droop, yet their Souls even <hi>then</hi> rejoice and triumph, and are veſted with Robes of Light and Gladneſs. So very deſirous are they to dye, that when dangerous Sickneſs wears off again, and fair Poſſibilities of Life return; the Senſe of this makes them dumpiſh and heavy, and is matter of Trouble and Affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to them.</p>
               <p>Now <hi>how</hi> Divine Comforts may ſtir up ſuch eager deſires of Death, is obvious and eaſy enough to apprehend. As for Death <hi>it ſelf</hi> (we have already hinted) it is no more <hi>deſirable</hi> to the very <hi>beſt,</hi> than to <hi>any</hi> elſe; nor is there any
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:34484:88"/> 
                  <hi>Reaſon</hi> why it ſhould be ſo. Pain and Sickneſs which uſher it in; and the Coffin and the Grave which follow after it; if conſidered in themſelves, are as little pleaſing to <hi>them,</hi> as to <hi>others.</hi> But then this is confeſſedly true on all hands, that when we have once taſted what is rarely ſweet, 'tis natural for us to deſire more of it: and <hi>where</hi> we are ſenſible moſt of it is, <hi>there</hi> we are moſt deſirous to be. Now the Comforts of GOD which deſcend from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, being ſo incomparably ſweet and pleaſant; they inflame us with Deſires of removing thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. And tho' our Way lies through the Gates of <hi>Death,</hi> yet our burning Deſires make us ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt to paſs them; that ſo we may exchange theſe imperfect Meaſures of delicious Comforts, for the Entire Fulneſs and Immenſity of them. The little <hi>Draughts</hi> we drink of them here, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage our Appetites after the <hi>Fountain</hi> from whence they ſpring. The ſlender <hi>Rivulets</hi> which run through us now, make us thirſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſatiably after that <hi>Ocean</hi> from whence they flow. Thoſe ſingle Rays which ſtrike us at preſent as through a creviſe, make us long inceſſantly to aſcend into the clear and open Light; and to ſit under the Gleams of that Eternal Sun, whoſe conſolatory Glories ſhall irradiate our Souls, and delight and ſatisfy them to everlaſting Ages. Thus the ſweet foretaſts of future Satisfactions, make us greedy of <hi>dying,</hi> that we may be fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally ſettled in the Poſſeſſion of them.</p>
               <p>And who can deny this to be a piece of true <hi>Bleſſedneſs? All</hi> muſt <hi>dye,</hi> and <hi>moſt</hi> are <hi>afraid</hi> of Death, and <hi>many</hi> fear it <hi>immoderately;</hi> they therefore that fear it not <hi>at all,</hi> but are lifted up ſo far above Fears, that they earneſtly <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire</hi>

But then here we muſt call to mind, that as this <hi>Bleſſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> alſo is the Offspring of <hi>Comforts,</hi> ſo are <hi>they</hi> of <hi>Mourning.</hi> And therefore as we would be bleſt in ſuch Comforts, as ſhall free us from <hi>extravagant Fears</hi> when we dye; or as ſhall turn our Fears into <hi>Deſires</hi> of Death: we muſt live holy <hi>Mourners.</hi>

               <p>THat holy Comforts are bleſſedly uſeful and beneficial to our <hi>Souls,</hi> what hath been ſaid on the foregoing Heads, does ſufficiently prove.

Nor is it at all ſtrange, that thoſe Comforts, which are no other than the ſweetneſs of Heaven in our <hi>Spirits;</hi> ſhould ſweetly affect the <hi>bodily</hi> Part of our Beings. For while the Spirit and the Fleſh continue in this ſtate of vital Union, as what is agreeable to the Fleſh, or Body, is frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pleaſing to the Soul, or Spirit: ſo on the contrary, what is highly delightful to the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, will often be recreative to the corporeal, fleſhly Part of us.</p>

Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs GOD, for great Reaſons, beſt known to Himſelf, ſhall pleaſe to order it otherwiſe.</p>
               <p>But then we muſt enquire <hi>whence</hi> is <hi>this?</hi> Or <hi>how</hi> comes it to be <hi>thus?</hi> Why ſhould Religion in the Soul, conduce to <hi>Healthfulneſs</hi> in the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy? The making out this, is the Scope of that Point which we are upon; and <hi>Solomon</hi> hath done it to our hand. I mean where he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares, that <hi>the ways of Wiſdom are ways of</hi> Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſantneſs, <hi>and that all her paths are</hi> Peace, <hi>Prov.</hi> 3.17. That virtuous Livers by being virtuous, have great Advantages of <hi>Health</hi> on their ſide, beyond others who are looſe and vitious in the World; cannot be denied. For their Piety and Purity, their Self-denial and Sobriety, their meek or diſpaſſionate Temper, and the Like; beſides, that they entitle them to the <hi>Bleſſing</hi> of Heaven, do effectually ſecure them from thoſe Diſorders of Mind, and Diſtempers of Body, which the contrary Evils naturally breed in them, or bring upon them. And then they as certainly prevent thoſe dreadful <hi>Viſitations,</hi> which as often come down <hi>judicially</hi> from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove, and are the ſad Revenges of divine Juſtice upon the Diſſolute and Licentious; as they are natural Effects of their being ſo. And farther, (as the wiſeſt of Men, we ſee, hath told us) they that walk on in the ways of Wiſdom (that are regular and perſevering in the ſeveral Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and progreſſive in the noble Perfections of
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:34484:91"/> Religion:) ſhall not fail to meet with <hi>Pleaſant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> and <hi>Peace.</hi> With ſuch Peace and Pleaſant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs as come from GOD, and fill the Soul with inexplicable <hi>Comforts.</hi> And theſe Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts (as little as ſome think it) may be good and great Inſtruments of <hi>Health</hi> unto us. As where the Body is well and ſtrong, they help to confirm it in that State; ſo where it happens to be weak and low, they raiſe and mend its Conſtitution. They put a ſpring of new Life, as it were into the Soul, which excites moſt pleaſing Motions in the Body; even ſuch as ſerve to inliven and invigorate it. For as ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king Grief does not only fret and imbitter the Mind, but withal caſts a ſad Damp upon the Body, and deadens the livelineſs of thoſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Motions, on which its Health depends, and by which it is conſerved: ſo heavenly Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts, where they are often and liberally im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted, do ordinarily produce the contrary Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects. They quicken the Spirits, where they move too ſlowly; and help the Bloud to circu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late more freely and nimbly, where 'tis ſubject to Stagnancy; and by taking off the ſharpneſs and ſowreneſs of them, they inſenſibly ſweeten and rectify both. By peculiar Motions which they put them into, they alter the Figures of their diſordered Particles; and ſo better the Maſs or Subſtance of them, with more Eaſe and Efficacy, than the beſt <hi>Phyſic</hi> can poſſibly do. And the Bloud and Spirits being thus corrected, and the Ferments of the Body made light, and ſoft, and ſmooth, and unctuous; the Wheels of Nature will by this means be freed from cumberſome Cloggs and Entanglements within; and in caſe no Violence happens from without,
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:34484:91"/> may run on a great way in a regular Courſe. And thus not only <hi>Life</hi> is prolonged (as Length <hi>of Days is in Wiſdom's right Hand, Prov.</hi> 3.16:) but that Life is made more <hi>happy,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Perſon injoying it is made more <hi>health<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful.</hi> And therefore we are taught by an incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable Writer, that <hi>the Fear of the</hi> LORD <hi>which maketh Peace</hi> (or produceth <hi>Comforts</hi> where it dwells) <hi>does</hi> thereby <hi>make</hi> perfect health <hi>to</hi> flouriſh, <hi>Ecclus.</hi> 1.18,</p>
               <p>Nor can it ſeem ſtrange that holy <hi>Comforts</hi> ſhould thus conduce to <hi>Health;</hi> if we do but remember what wonderful Effects they have had upon <hi>Martyrs;</hi> turning their dying Pangs into rapturous Pleaſures: as was<note n="*" place="margin">Chap. 11.

               <p>Firſt, By bringing us into <hi>better Acquaintance</hi> with the ALMIGHTY.

               <p>As to the Perſwaſion of the <hi>Certainty</hi> of His <hi>Exiſtence,</hi> it roots no where ſo deep, and grows no where ſo ſtrong, as where 'tis well watered by divine <hi>Conſolations.</hi> There is no ſuch forci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Demonſtration as they, of the <hi>Being</hi> of a GOD. What ſolid <hi>Reaſoning</hi> does but <hi>prove</hi> in this caſe, the Man under Comforts even <hi>feels</hi> in Himſelf. The HOLY GHOST ſpeaks of Mens <hi>feeling after</hi> GOD, and finding Him out ſo, <hi>Act.</hi> 17.27. But none do that ſo well and ſatisfactorily, as they upon whom divine Comforts reſt. Scarce any thing almoſt (be it never ſo tangible, or never ſo palpable) can be more obvious to their Touch or Handling; than GOD is to their ſpiritual or inward Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception. Their Sentiments of Him are ſo quick and lively, that they convince them more throughly, and convince them more power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, that He <hi>is;</hi> than the brighteſt Speculative
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:34484:94"/> Evidence can do, when it ſtrikes their Minds with cleareſt diſcoveries.</p>
               <p>Philoſophy can make it out, that the Wind blows, and that the Light ſhines, and that Meat and Drink which are taken for Nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, do refreſh and ſtrengthen: but they who <hi>feel</hi> theſe <hi>Effects,</hi> are more <hi>aſſured</hi> of them, than they that only <hi>hear</hi> them <hi>talkt</hi> of, and attend to the Loudeſt argumentative Proofs of them. So Reaſon and Diſcourſe may prove there is a GOD; but they whom He honours with the enjoyment of His <hi>Comforts,</hi> know that He <hi>is,</hi> upon ſurer Grounds: I mean, the raviſhing <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluences</hi> which He caſts upon them, and the <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions</hi> which they make on their pure Minds. The delightful Converſe they have with Him, and the reviving Joys they perceive from Him, ſeal up this Truth with a ſenſible Teſtimony, and evince His Exiſtence beyond all Argumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation the beſt <hi>Topics</hi> can afford. As impoſſible it is for them that ſit under the Gleams of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation, to queſtion GOD's Being; as it is for them to doubt of the Being of the Sun, who feel the Heat, and ſee the Brightneſs of his cheriſhing Beams.</p>
               <p>And this <hi>home</hi> Perſwaſion of the <hi>Exiſtence</hi> of a GOD, is the <hi>main Pillar</hi> which ſupports the <hi>Delights</hi> of all good Men. Were it not for <hi>that</hi> which under-props them, they would forthwith ſink and fall flat to the Ground. And well they might. For take GOD out of the World, and how ſorry a thing would it immediately prove? and how deſpicable and lamentable would <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving</hi> in it be, to all Men at once? For then (according to <hi>Atheiſts</hi> nonſenſical Hypotheſis) as all things were made by blind Chance, ſo
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:34484:94"/> they muſt be govern'd by giddy Fortune. And being under ſo weak and wild a Conduct, muſt neceſſarily run on through diſmal Irregularities, into dreadful Confuſion. Nor would it be worſe with <hi>Nature,</hi> than with <hi>Morality.</hi> For then there being nothing to give check to licentious Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, or to controll the Inclinations and Practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the Diſſolute; their Power and Will would be their Rule and Law; and their Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures and Intereſts would be their ultimate End; and rampant Vice, and predominant Malice (through Pride, and Luſt, and Tyranny and Revenge) would drive on outragiouſly to the Top of Rapine, and all Exceſs. And thus the whole Earth would be turn'd, in a Trice, to the moſt horrid Wilderneſs, and Men into the worſt wild Beaſts that inhabit it.</p>
               <p>How ſtrange is it therefore that any ſhould ever ſo <hi>dote</hi> upon <hi>Atheiſm,</hi> as to court and be fond of that curſed Opinion! An Opinion ſo monſtrouſly unreaſonable in it ſelf, and attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with ſuch evil and pernicious Conſequents; that they ought to reject it with higheſt Dete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtation in their own <hi>Defence.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But as there is a GOD, who in ſpite of all baſe Enemies to His Being, will maintain the Beauty and Order of the Univerſe; and will keep up true Virtue and Goodneſs among Men, to the End of this World: ſo they that live in the ſenſe of His <hi>Comforts,</hi> muſt live in the ſenſe of His <hi>Exiſtence</hi> too. And that deep and lively ſenſe of His Being, which holy Conſolations imprint upon them; will repleniſh them with ſuch dear and gratifying <hi>Delights,</hi> that they would not part with it upon any Terms. And as they would not upon any account part with their
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:34484:95"/> ſenſe of GOD's <hi>Exiſtence;</hi> ſo much leſs with His <hi>Being</hi> it ſelf. They would not for a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand thouſand Worlds, that the true GOD <hi>were not;</hi> or that He were any <hi>other</hi> than <hi>what</hi> He <hi>is.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Their ſenſe of His Being, makes them ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble alſo of <hi>many Benefits</hi> and <hi>mighty Advantages</hi> which accrue to them from it. As that when they Complain, they have a GOD to hear them. When they Pray, they have a GOD to anſwer them. When they are Afflicted, they have a GOD to ſupport them; and alſo to ſanctify their Sufferings to them. When they do their Duties, they have a GOD to aſſiſt them. When their Duties are done, they have a GOD to reward them. While they live, they have a GOD to bleſs them. When they dye, they have a GOD to take care of them. After they are dead they have a GOD to crown them. And when the ſweet <hi>ſenſe</hi> of of all this (and of a great deal more) is ſtrong upon them; it cannot but produce exceſſive <hi>Delights;</hi> Delights as noble in their Nature, as they are exquiſite in their Sweetneſs.</p>
               <p>As there is no worſe <hi>Terror,</hi> and no greater <hi>Torment</hi> to the guilty Souls of the Irreligious, than the ſtinging Conviction of the <hi>Exiſtence</hi> of a GOD; ſo the Pleaſures that the vivid Senſe of His Being, yields to the Penitent, or truly Righteous under Conſolations; are as unſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able. But becauſe they are ſo, let us ſay no more of them.</p>
               <p>Yet we are to note, that as divine Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts bring us to a quick ſenſe of the <hi>Certainty</hi> of GOD's Being, and thereby raiſe us to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Delights: ſo they make us happy in the
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:34484:95"/> ſame Delights, by leading us into a <hi>right Notion</hi> of the <hi>Excellency</hi> of His <hi>Nature.</hi> The Mind of Man is a moſt buſy Thing. And as it is active about <hi>other</hi> Objects, ſo it will be about GOD Himſelf. And when our Thoughts imploy themſelves about <hi>Him,</hi> if they feign improper Ideas of Him, and exhibit Him to us in never ſo <hi>falſe</hi> Images, or erroneous Conceptions: yet they ſpringing up in our <hi>Minds,</hi> and ſo moſt throughly and ſtrongly poſſeſſing them; we are apt to ſuſpect, or believe them <hi>true,</hi> and that He really <hi>is,</hi> what our gariſh and miſguided Fancies <hi>make</hi> Him. And tho' 'tis hard to give in an exact Account, of all our vain <hi>Fictions,</hi> and Miſrepreſentations of GOD; yet this may go for a general Rule, and in obſerving it we ſhall find that we are pretty conſtant. <hi>We uſually aſſimilate</hi> GOD <hi>unto our ſelves, and our Ideas of Him correſpond to our own Complexions, or Tempers.</hi> Thus, he whoſe Breaſt is ſurcharg'd with boiling Malice, and a ſwelling Spleen a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his Neighbour; thinks GOD is full of livid Envy, Rancour, and deadly Hatred to Men. And He whoſe Brain is heated and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturb'd with fiery Spirits, and whoſe Mind is toſs'd with unbecoming Rage, and Phrantic Fury; conceives GOD is little better than a Flame of Paſſion: one that loves, at times, to ſally forth in Flaſhes of devouring Venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, and to conſume His helpleſs undeſerving Creatures.</p>
               <p>And becauſe all darker Minds indeed are ready to harbour crooked Thoughts of GOD, concerning the <hi>Rigidneſs</hi> of His Diſpoſition: He endeavours in His Word to prevent their enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining any hard and hideous Apprehenſions of
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:34484:96"/> Him. For there He teaches,<note n="*" place="margin">Iſai. 27.4.</note> 
                  <hi>Fury dwelleth not in Him.</hi> That<note n="†" place="margin">ch. 28.21.</note> 
                  <hi>Judgment is</hi> His <hi>ſtrange Work.</hi> That He <hi>doth not</hi>

                  <hi>Merciful and Gracious.</hi> That His<note n="†" place="margin">ch. 33.18, 19.</note> Glory is <hi>Goodneſs.</hi> Not to ſay, That His very<note n="‖" place="margin">1 Joh. 4.8.</note> Eſſence <hi>is Love.</hi> And how incomparably Excellent muſt His Nature be, of which theſe are the true and genuine Characters? But when GOD by this fair De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of Himſelf, fences againſt all black Thoughts of His MAJESTY; for us then to faſten ſuch Thoughts upon Him (when He ſtrives induſtriouſly to beat them off) muſt not only be ſhameful Folly, but hainous Sin; as being diſhonourable to Him, as well as pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judicial and deſtructive to our ſelves. Here therefore holy Comforts again are helpful to us. I mean as they <hi>rectify</hi> our <hi>Miſtakes</hi> of GOD, and diſabuſe our Minds from harſh and horrid Imaginations of Him, by inabling us to judge more rightly concerning Him.</p>
               <p>For however too many that are clouded with Sins, and ſo encompaſs'd with Fears, and ſo kept in a dark and diſconſolate condition; may conceive very uncouth and frightful things of the Bleſſed GOD: however they may think Him Touchy and Supercilious, Ireful and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placable; and take Him for no better than a vowed Enemy to all Sinners Happineſs, and inexorable Author of their endleſs Ruine; or at leaſt for one indifferently affected with what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever befalls them, and wholly unconcerned whether they <hi>live,</hi> or <hi>dye</hi> eternally: Yet where the Comforts of Heaven dwell, down go ſuch incongruous Thoughts of the DEITY; and others more becoming, and alſo more agreeable
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:34484:96"/> are advanced in their Room. And well they may; for ſacred Comforts, as we have ſaid, do <hi>better</hi> our <hi>Genius,</hi> or improve our Temper. They do not only help us as to <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, a <hi>good Capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city</hi> of Nature; rendring our Minds (by well compoſing them, and keeping them in order) more <hi>fit</hi> to think, and more <hi>acute</hi> in their Thoughts; whereby they are inabled to more ſuitable and worthy Apprehenſions of the AL<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MIGHTY: but moreover they impregnate us with <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, a <hi>good Diſpoſition</hi> of Nature. They put a great deal of Kindneſs and Lenity into us; and making us mild, and ſweet, and benign in our ſelves, we ſhall (according to the Rule juſt now laid down) in courſe conclude that GOD is <hi>infinitely</hi> ſo. For look what <hi>we</hi> are, and <hi>ſuch</hi> we preſently conceive <hi>Him</hi> to be. In caſe we doubt it, the SPIRIT proves it. <hi>Thou thoughteſt that I was altogether ſuch a one as thy ſelf, Pſal.</hi> 50.21. And if Evil Men, becauſe they are evil, think GOD to be <hi>like</hi> them; then by the ſame Reaſon, the <hi>better</hi> we are, the better <hi>Thoughts</hi> we ſhall have of <hi>Him.</hi> So that from the Melioration or Improvement of our own Temper, we naturally riſe up into the more fit and genuine Conceptions of GOD. And the meet Idea, or proper Character of His Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, being by this means the more fairly drawn or ſtamped upon our Minds; from hence again will ſpring moſt Bleſſed <hi>Delights.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For they that (ſo far as humane Meaſures reach) attain to a right Notion of GOD's excellent Nature; do plainly ſee Him with an intellectual Eye. And they that ſee <hi>Him,</hi> ſee a moſt exquiſite and moſt infinite Beauty. A Beauty conſiſting of ſuch eſſential Glories, and
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:34484:97"/> divineſt Perfections, that all other Beauties in compare with it, are but Dirt, and Darkneſs, and the uglieſt Deformity. And as ſuch a Beauty, when beheld with an intent and fixed Eye, muſt raiſe great <hi>Admiration</hi> in thoſe that view it, ſo that Admiration muſt cauſe as great <hi>Delights,</hi> and thoſe Delights, a rare kind of <hi>Bleſſedneſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I cannot but caſt in this as an Overplus: that they who have the trueſt Notion of GOD's Nature and ſo the cleareſt Proſpect of His bright and beauteous Excellencies; are not more bleſſed than others in <hi>ſeeing</hi> Him only, but in <hi>ſerving</hi> Him alſo. For all that they do in Adora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Him, or in Obedience to Him, (He being the object of their higheſt Delights) muſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly be <hi>pleaſant</hi> as well as <hi>eaſy</hi> to them; and matter of <hi>Felicity,</hi> as well as of Duty. Indeed as many as have groſs and griſly Apprehenſions of GOD, can know no Religion but what is <hi>Mechanical.</hi> They never pay any Service to Heaven with hearty Willingneſs; nor act its Commands from a free, ingenuous, and noble Choice. But when they move towards Duties, they are forc'd to do it by ſlaviſh Fears; and when they run through them, 'tis meerly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they dare not pretermit them: Neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Conſtraint give Laws to their Devotion. But they who conceive of GOD as they ſhould, worſhip Him as they ought. They do not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly perform His Service, but they do it chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully and faithfully; ſo they will do it to the End of their Days. For what they do of that nature, proceeds from a Principle of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Life, and from the Power of a divine Love within.</p>
               <pb n="181" facs="tcp:34484:97"/>
               <p>And this brings me to the <hi>Second</hi> Means whereby holy Comforts furniſh us with ſuch high and noble <hi>Delights,</hi> as will ſtick by us, When all other forſake us: and that is, by <hi>inflaming us with Love to the</hi> LORD JESUS. For where this Flame is throughly kindled, it fills the Heart with ſuch ſacred Ardors, as turn the Saints into lower <hi>Seraphim;</hi> and while they are but <hi>Men,</hi> make them like to <hi>Angels.</hi> Like to Angels, not only in their Purity and burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Zeal; but alſo in their Pleaſures and exta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic Delights.</p>
               <p>Where Souls are throughly enamoured on CHRIST, that their Affections run high, we need not doubt. No Tongue can tell the heat and vigour of that holy Love, which flames in the Hearts of good Men towards Him. So ſuperlative is it, that to compare it with any <hi>natural</hi> or <hi>civil</hi> Love, were to diſparage it, or detract from it. The Love of a Wife to her Husband is great; and ſo is the Love of a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to her Child; and ſo is the Love of a Man to his faithful Friend. But all are ſhort of true Love to JESUS. And that they muſt be ſo, we are well aſſured by the Word from Heaven. For that informs us, that as it is the <hi>firſt</hi> and <hi>great</hi> Command (and ſo our prime and chief Duty) to <hi>love</hi> the LORD; ſo it tells us, at what <hi>Rate</hi> we muſt do it: even <hi>with all our Heart, and with all our Soul, and with all our Mind, Mat.</hi> 22.37. Our Love to <hi>Him</hi> muſt be raiſed to an higher Pitch than what it ſtands in to any thing elſe. And there's Reaſon for it. For in that its Elevation or Superiority; in that its Pre-eminence above, or Prevalence over all other Affections; lies the very <hi>Sincerity</hi> or <hi>Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence</hi>
                  <pb n="182" facs="tcp:34484:98"/> of it. So that to love CHRIST no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than other Things or Perſons, is indeed not to Love Him at all: not at all duly, and ſo not at all acceptably. And the ſame Word tells us, that Love to CHRIST is ſuch (for Ardency) <hi>as many Waters cannot quench, nor Flouds drown, Cant.</hi> 8.7. And again it tells us, of true Lovers of Him, that they are <hi>ſick of Love</hi> to Him, <hi>Cant.</hi> 2.5. A plain caſe, that Love to CHRIST is a Paſſion ſo ſtrong, and that the Fits of it, in ſome, are ſo violent and high; that they affect them with a kind of <hi>Sickneſs.</hi> The Expreſſion came from the HOLY GHOST; and believe it, there is nothing Hyperbolical in it. No Rhetorical Strain, or Figurative Scheme of Speech. Nothing Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chreſtical or Improper. What it affirms is lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally true without Flouriſh. There are thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands of eminent Chriſtians in the Church, whoſe Affections to JESUS are ſo vigorous, whoſe Deſires of Him are ſo vehement, whoſe Longings after Him are ſo earneſt; that they bring perfect <hi>Qualms</hi> over their Hearts, and make them quite <hi>ſick</hi> of Love to His MAJE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>STY. And where a <hi>pure Mind</hi> is carri'd out in ſo <hi>powerful a Love,</hi> to an Object that is infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely <hi>perfect</hi> and <hi>glorious;</hi> let Reaſon judge how <hi>inconceivably</hi> delightful its Actings muſt be.</p>
               <p>O LOVE!<note n="*" place="margin">O Amor! quid te Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellam neſcio; dulcem, an aſperum; ſuavem, an injucundum.

For ſo full of both thou art, that thou ſeemeſt to be both. And moſt true is this, of our kindeſt Love to
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:34484:98"/> 
                  <hi>one another.</hi> It is at beſt but a Miſcellaneous thing. A Compound made up of two Ingre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dients, <hi>ſome ſatisfaction,</hi> and <hi>much uneaſineſs.</hi> But Love to CHRIST is of quite another Nature. He that feels that divine Paſſion, finds nothing in it but divine Pleaſure. His Mind is full of Peace; his Soul dwells at Eaſe; and his Spirit is wrapt up in moſt heavenly Delights. Delights ſo bliſsful, that there are none like them, but thoſe above, in the eternal World. Divine Love is the ſweeteſt Power that humane Souls are capable of, and the moſt perfect GOD is the ſole Object of that Power. And therefore whenever it is imploy'd in receiving the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluxes of His ſpecial Favour; and in ſending up ſtreams of reciprocal Affection to His MA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>JESTY; O LORD what Delights muſt here be produc'd? No leſs for certain, than ſuch as are beatifying beyond Expreſſion. And that indeed is the trueſt Character of them, they are <hi>inexpreſſible.</hi> When we call them ſo, we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally ſay more what they are, and give in a juſter Deſcription of them, than if leaving <hi>that</hi> out, we ſhould diſcourſe never ſo long and largely concerning them.</p>
               <p>And let any judge that are able to do it; if thoſe <hi>Comforts</hi> that raiſe this <hi>Love,</hi> which cauſes theſe Delights; do not render Men truly Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. For when Time hath ſunk them never ſo low, and Old age hath worn them even quite out, and both together have put them paſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhing all other Pleaſures: they'll fill the Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious with ſuch a Love, as will repleniſh them with ſuch Delights, as will affect them with unſpeakable Sweetneſs.</p>
               <pb n="184" facs="tcp:34484:99"/>
               <p>But then Holy Mourning being one chief Door, at which theſe bleſſed Comforts enter, and come in upon us; as many as would be Bleſſed in theſe Delights, which they occaſion, and which ſurvive all other; muſt look upon it as a thing moſt eligible, and for their own be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit muſt conſcionably uſe it, and keep cloſe to it.</p>

               </argument>
               <p>A Great deal, and very great things have been ſaid of holy Comforts, which are Fruits or Effects of Religious Mourning. Yet no more than is proper and applicable to them, as being indeed moſt true concerning them. For ſuch is their excellent Worth and Uſefulneſs that they do not only anſwer the Character given them, but would eaſily fill up one far more large and comprehenſive.</p>
               <p>And yet as incomparable as theſe Comforts are, there is a kind of <hi>mimical</hi> or <hi>mock-comforts</hi> like them. And tho' they be <hi>falſe,</hi> they are Images or Counterfeits of the true; and to them that ſit under the Influence of them (which is Evil and Malignant) may prove to be of perni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious conſequence.</p>
               <p>That there <hi>are</hi> Falſe Comforts, we need not queſtion; for we have loud Hints of them in the holy Books: let us note but <hi>two.</hi>
               </p>

               <pb n="187" facs="tcp:34484:100"/>
               <p>We muſt withal remember, that theſe falſe Joys, or Comforts being <hi>different</hi> from the true; they will likewiſe have different <hi>Operations,</hi> and by them will produce very different <hi>Effects.</hi> So that whereas <hi>true</hi> Comforts inliven the Mind, and chear the Heart, and delight the Spirit; and laying faſt hold of Men by their powerful Charms, and taking them in their ſoft and ſweet Intanglements, draw them ſtill nearer and nearer to GOD, and intice them to higher Degrees of Righteouſneſs, indearing even all that is good to them: <hi>Falſe</hi> ones on the other ſide, which come down upon them that are diſſolute; are apt to encourage and harden them in Care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſneſs. And becauſe when they do ill, no ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Inconvenience enſues upon it; but they find they are at Eaſe, and a ſecret Pleaſure at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends their Exorbitancies: this rivets them cloſe to their immoral Practices, and makes it next to impoſſible for them to leave them. And then, which is worſe, theſe unhappy Ones do often Fancy their <hi>falſe</hi> Comforts to be <hi>true;</hi> and their egregious miſtake proves of evil con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence. For while they ſo conceit, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude concerning them; they ſeal up their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wary deluded Souls in a deep Security, and cauſe them to flatter themſelves with Thoughts of Peace, and Hopes of Safety, till they ſink into fearful unexpected Ruine.

               </p>
               <p>Now it being thus evident, that there are <hi>falſe</hi> Comforts, and that they very much imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate or reſemble the <hi>true;</hi> and yet are as diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:34484:101"/> from them in their Operations, and as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to them in their Effects; as they are ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly like them in ſome Qualities and Symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms: this may be matter of concern to good Chriſtians, and may occaſion them <hi>Trouble</hi> and great <hi>Solicitude.</hi> For they conſidering that there are ſuch counterfeit and fallacious Comforts, and that they have ſo miſchievous an Influence and Tendency; will be fit to ſurmiſe that <hi>theirs</hi> are no better; and that notwithſtanding the ſingular content they find in them, they will greatly indanger, rather than advantage them. And how ſuch a ſuſpicion would vex their Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, and what Uneaſineſs ſuch a Jealouſy would bring upon them; is not eaſiy to ſay. To keep the Miſperſuaſion therefore out of good Minds, where it is not entred; and to cure or kill it where 'tis gotten in: it will be neceſſary to ſet down the principal <hi>Marks</hi> of genuine Comforts.

               <p>The <hi>Time</hi> wherein true Comforts <hi>come,</hi> is moſtly when we are <hi>well imploy'd.</hi> The <hi>Objects</hi> whence they <hi>flow,</hi> are commonly <hi>divine.</hi> The <hi>Inſtruments</hi> whereby they <hi>riſe</hi> are <hi>moſt coeleſtial.</hi> The <hi>Effects</hi> which they <hi>produce,</hi> are ever <hi>pious.</hi> And the <hi>State</hi> which we are <hi>in</hi> muſt ſtill be <hi>righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous.</hi>

               <pb n="189" facs="tcp:34484:101"/>
               <p>The <hi>Firſt Mark</hi> of true Comforts is, <hi>They moſtly viſit us when we are well imployed.</hi> When we are conſcionably buſied in thoſe devout Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſes which GOD, hath injoin'd us. Which He hath laid upon us, as Teſts of our Sincerity, as Inſtances of our Duty, as Conditions of our Happineſs, and as Means to advance His own Honour, by bettering and improving of our Nature. Of this ſort of Exerciſes, are ſervent Praying, attentive Hearing, religious Watching, ſolemn Faſting, humble Mourning, holy Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municating, liberal Alms-giving, patient Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering, the Angelic Work of ſinging Praiſes to GOD, and the like. When we are buſi'd in theſe or other ſuch high and divine Imployments; if then holy Comforts break in upon us, they prove themſelves in ſome meaſure to be genuine. For they encourage and abet us in that which is good; a fair Argument, if not a ſure Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence that they proceed from GOD.</p>
               <p>And when our Minds are <hi>unbent,</hi> and our Virtuous Imployments are laid aſide; if they viſit us at any time, in the <hi>Intervals</hi> of Duty or in our innocent <hi>Reſts</hi> or <hi>Ceſſations</hi> from the ſame; they muſt ſtill be true. For however the <hi>Acts</hi> of Virtue for a while are then intermitted, yet the <hi>Habits</hi> of it remain entire: and when they come in ſuch Junctures, as they ſerve to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence Duties paſt, ſo they diſpoſe and whet us on to other approaching. And where they come at ſo ſeaſonable Times, as happily to mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter to ſuch excellent Ends; they intimate themſelves to be of the right Kind.</p>
               <p>But if Comforts uſually riſe within us, when we are vainly ſet, or vitiouſly inclined, or actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally ingaged an evil Practices, and eagerly run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:34484:102"/> on in licentious Courſes: this aloud pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claims them to be <hi>falſe</hi> and <hi>counterfeit,</hi> and argues that they are not from the Bleſſed SPIRIT. For He that injoins us not to bid the wicked GOD<note n="*" place="margin">2 Joh. 10.</note> 
                  <hi>Speed;</hi> will never ſo interfere with his own Injunction, as to countenance any in their naughty Ways, by communicating hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Conſolations to them, while they perſiſt in Sin and Lewdneſs.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Second Mark</hi> of true Comforts is, <hi>they commonly flow from divine Objects.</hi> Men<note n="†" place="margin">Mat. 7 6.</note> 
                  <hi>do not gather Grapes of Thorns, nor Figgs of Thiſtles:</hi> not can we expect to reap heavenly Comforts, from earthly Grounds or Conſiderations. Joys that are divine, muſt ſpring up from divine Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects; and be deriv'd to us by divine Vehicles or Conveyances. GOD, or His Attributes, or Mercies; CHRIST, or His Merits, or Benefits; the HOLY GHOST, or His Graces, or Favours; HEAVEN, or its Glories, or Felicities; or ſome other noble Spiritual Excellencies, muſt be in our Minds, when Holy Conſolations overflow our Souls. For being of ſo divine a Nature themſelves, they can never grow but upon ſuch Stocks as are congenerous, or of the ſame kind with them.</p>
               <p>If from theſe <hi>Objects</hi> therefore, or from any <hi>like</hi> them, we derive our Comforts; here may be ſome Sign that they are genuine. For they, as we read of the Baptiſm of <hi>John,</hi> they may be from Heaven, and not of Men; as flowing rot from the nether, but the upper Springs. But in caſe our Comforts be rooted in the <hi>Earth,</hi> and grow up from <hi>below</hi> only; that is, from a ſenſe of Health and Strength, of Eaſe and
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:34484:102"/> Peace, of Plenty and Proſperity: from the largeſt Supplies of ſecular Proviſions, and the fulleſt Poſſeſſion of perſonal Accompliſhments; and ſo from the higheſt and compleateſt Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs, that is here attainable: we may ground upon it that they are but ſpurious. For Worldly Comforts they muſt needs be, that are bred and nouriſht by Worldly Accommodations. And therefore if our Comforts reſult from ſuch only: if they ſpring and flouriſh in us, becauſe we can ſay, Theſe are our Children, and theſe are our Friends; theſe are our Houſes, and theſe are our Lands; theſe are our Riches, and theſe our Honours, or the like; 'tis apparent. e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough that they are of low Extraction, and but little Worth, if they riſe no higher.</p>
               <p>Tho' I cannot but add, that even theſe <hi>out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,</hi> inferior <hi>Objects</hi> may ſometimes open a <hi>way</hi> to true Comforts. I mean, as they point at Objects that are <hi>divine,</hi> and lead and lift up our Minds unto them. Thus the Charms of Eloquence, Beauty, or melodious Harmony; Curious Sights, delicious Taſtes, fragrant Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fumes, or any high Pleaſures that ſtrike the Soul through the Organs of Senſe; may carry up our Thoughts to the glorious Felicities of the everlaſting State. And when they are ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly fixt on thoſe divine Things, they'll eaſily fill us with divine Comforts. But then theſe Comforts flow from thoſe divine and heavenly Objects; and not from any of the exterior ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible ones, which only prompted us to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation of the other.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Third Mark</hi> of true Comforts is, <hi>they are raiſed by Inſtruments moſt Coeleſtial.</hi> Indeed the only primary, or principal Efficient cauſe of
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:34484:103"/> them, is GOD Himſelf. And therefore as many as would have them, muſt apply them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves for them ſolely to <hi>Him.</hi> So we learn, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.82. <hi>When wilt</hi> THOU <hi>comfort me?</hi> And <hi>Pſal.</hi> 86.4. <hi>rejoice the Soul of Thy Servant, for unto</hi> Thee, O LORD, <hi>do I lift up my Soul.</hi> But when Comforts are derived from GOD to His Servants, it muſt always be done by the Intervention, and Uſe of ſome <hi>heavenly</hi> things, as <hi>inſtrumental</hi> thereunto. I mention but <hi>Two</hi> of them; <hi>The Light of</hi> GOD's <hi>Countenance,</hi> And <hi>the Contents of His Word.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That Holy Comforts are raiſed by <hi>the Light</hi> of GOD's <hi>Countenance,</hi> is evident. For they are ſaid to be the <hi>Joy of his Countenance, Pſal.</hi> 21.6.<note n="*" place="margin">

                  </note> 
                  <hi>Thou haſt gladded him with the</hi> Joy of Thy Countenance. And in the Fourth <hi>Pſalm,</hi> the Light of GOD's Countenance is ſaid to put <hi>Gladneſs</hi> in the Heart. Tho' <hi>what</hi> that <hi>coeleſtial Light</hi> is, is much better felt, than it can be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs'd. I think it no other than a faint or ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure Glimpſe of that raviſhing Glory of the Face of GOD, the clear ſight of the full Brightneſs of which, ſhall make the <hi>Beatific Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion</hi> in Heaven.</p>
               <p>And then that <hi>the Contents of the Word</hi> are In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrumental to raiſing holy Comforts in us; is as manifeſt. For as we read, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 19.8. <hi>the Statutes of the</hi> LORD rejoyce <hi>the Heart.</hi> They excite ſuch Conſolations in us, as fill us with deep and ſolid Joys. And therefore at the 10th Verſe, the HOLY GHOST ſets them forth by a remarkable Character, and lofty Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation. <hi>More to be deſired are they than Gold; yea, than much fine Gold: ſweeter alſo than Honey, and the Honey-comb.</hi> He does not only preferr
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:34484:103"/> the Contents of GOD's Word before <hi>much</hi> Gold, but before the <hi>moſt refined</hi> Gold that can be. He does not only preferr them before <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,</hi> but before the <hi>pureſt</hi> Honey that is; even before that which of its own accord drops from the Comb. And ſo by two emphatical Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſons, and a very ſignificant Gradation in each; He extolls them<note n="*" place="margin">Conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guntur haec ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hementiae ergo. <hi>Ainſwor.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>vehemently</hi> for the moſt <hi>ſweet</hi> and <hi>precious</hi> things in the World. For what can be more ſweet than pureſt Honey? and what more precious than fineſt Gold? Yet the Contents of the Scripture, according to this Account of the HOLY GHOST, are more ſweet than the <hi>one,</hi> and more preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous than the <hi>other,</hi> and more deſirable than <hi>both.</hi> And leſt any ſhould think this Compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon <hi>ſhort,</hi> becauſe <hi>Gemms</hi> are more precious than fineſt Gold; the <hi>Septuagint</hi> inſtead of comparing GOD's Statutes to <hi>that,</hi> ſays they are to be deſired,<note n="†" place="margin">

                  <hi>above precious Stones:</hi> and the <hi>Syriac,</hi> and <hi>Arabic</hi> do the ſame. And well they may, in regard of thoſe tranſporting invaluable <hi>Joys,</hi> which they let into our Hearts.</p>
               <p>Look therefore and ſee <hi>whence</hi> your Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts come when they viſit you. When you are ſenſible of them, <hi>how</hi> are they produced? Are they a Light that ſhines into your Hearts from above? or a Fire in your Breaſts kindled by a Beam from the Face of GOD? If they be ſo, they muſt be holy Things, as being wrought in us, by ſo heavenly an Inſtrument. Nor will it be <hi>hard</hi> to diſcern whether they be <hi>thus</hi> effected. For ſuppoſing that we are really <hi>good,</hi> and that we cannot find, that they are raiſed wholly in us by <hi>worldly</hi> Conſiderations; they muſt of neceſſity proceed from GOD,
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:34484:104"/> from the Light of His Countenance, darted in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to our Souls. And when <hi>that</hi> is inſtrumental to the Production of them, tho' we cannot plainly make it out to <hi>others,</hi> that it is ſo; yet we may feel it powerfully in <hi>our ſelves,</hi> by quick and lively, tho' inexplicable Perceptions. For then we ſhall be ſenſible of ſuch Light, and Love divine; of ſuch Exaltations of Mind, and Inlargements of Spirit; of ſuch holy Thoughts, and generous Deſires, and Angelic Delights; as will witneſs by evictive and ineffable Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony within us, that they come directly from the Rays of GOD's Favour.</p>
               <p>Or if you do not perceive that they flow from the <hi>Light of</hi> GOD's <hi>Countenance</hi> ſingly; then conſult your Experience again, and ſee if the Inſtruments raiſing them in conjunction with that Light, be not ſome <hi>Paſſages</hi> of the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred <hi>Word.</hi> For tho' <hi>that Light alone</hi> be ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to raiſe Conſolations in us; and to raiſe them even to any Degree (as being the Power of GOD, to which all things are poſſible) yet nothing elſe, <hi>without</hi> the help of that, can cauſe them to riſe to a rapturous heigth. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider therefore, I ſay, do <hi>the Contents of</hi> GOD's <hi>Word</hi> in complication with the favourable In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence of His Countenance, repleniſh you with Comforts? We are told very plainly by an infallible Writer, that GOD's <hi>Teſtimonies are</hi> Wonderful, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.129: and that in His Law there are <hi>wondrous things,</hi> v. 18th. And ſo indeed there are, and enough of divers ſorts, to affect Men with wondrous <hi>Conſolations,</hi> if duly attended to.</p>
               <p>For there are DOCTRINES <hi>wonderful</hi> for <hi>Purity</hi> and <hi>Perfection.</hi> Such as teach us to
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:34484:104"/> deny our ſelves; and to deny ungodlineſs, and worldly luſts: To be holy, as GOD is holy; and merciful, as He is merciful; and perfect, as He is perfect. To do good unto all; to do good againſt evil; and to overcome evil with good.</p>
               <p>There are MYSTERIES <hi>wonderful</hi> for <hi>Profoundneſs</hi> and <hi>Intricacy.</hi> As that of the Glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous TRINITY; of the Incarnation of the WORD; of CHRIST's Union with His Church; of the Communication of His bleſſed Body and Blood, by conſecrated Elements, to worthy Partakers of His holy Table. Which tho' they be great and infallible Truths, are dark and enigmatical, and full of divine and venera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Abſtruſeneſs.</p>
               <p>There are REVELATIONS <hi>wonderful</hi> for <hi>Sublimity</hi> and <hi>Nobleneſs.</hi> As thoſe of the Creation of the World; of the Fall of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels; of the Sin, and Redemption of Man; of the Immortality of the Soul; of the Reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Body; and of the general and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Judgment.</p>
               <p>There are PROMISES <hi>wonderful</hi> for <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Preciouſneſs.</hi> As of GOD's hearing our Prayers; His pitying our Infirmities; His aſſiſting us in Duties; His accepting our Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances; His pardoning our Miſcarriages; His purifying our Souls; His ſpeaking peace to our Conſciences; His ſupplying us with Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings; His adorning us with Virtues and Graces in this Life; and His crowning us with ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting and glorious Recompences in the next.</p>
               <p>Theſe (amongſt others) are <hi>wonderful Things,</hi> which are contained in the ſacred Books. And when we rightly apprehend them, and ruminate
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:34484:105"/> upon them, or upon any of them; they will not fail to lift up our Religious Minds into re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhing Joys: eſpecially if the Light of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Countenance be diſplay'd upon us at the ſame Time. Then both the Heavenly <hi>Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> of Comfort, being at once ſet a Work; they cannot but produce it at a mighty Rate.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Fourth Mark</hi> of true Comforts is, <hi>they are productive of pious Effects.</hi> That they ſhould have <hi>no</hi> Effects, being powerful things, would be very ſtrange: and that they ſhould have any but <hi>good</hi> ones, muſt be as impoſſible, conſidering how excellent they are in <hi>themſelves,</hi> and from <hi>whence</hi> they come. Their Nature and Origin proclaim them Operative; and all the effects which they work in us, are abſolutely pious, or tending to Godlineſs. Amongſt <hi>many,</hi> we are ſure to find theſe that follow. Hatred of Sin, and Love to Righteouſneſs; Gentleneſs of Spirit, and Tenderneſs of Conſcience; Fear to offend GOD, and Forwardneſs to pleaſe Him. Purity of Mind, and Integrity of Life; Diſguſt of earthly things, and Deſire of Heavenly ones; Wearineſs of the World, and Willingneſs to go out of it. Wherever therefore Comforts have ſuch Effects and Symptoms, they have Evidence on their ſide, to prove that they are right. But where they find men bad, in caſe they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue ſo; or if inſtead of growing better, they become worſe under them: we may ceaſe all Enquiry concerning their truth, becauſe there's enough to evince they are falſe.</p>
               <p>And as one Specific inſeparable <hi>Effect</hi> of genuine Comforts, I might here mention their peculiar <hi>ſweetneſs.</hi> For tho' all Comforts carry ſweetneſs with them where they go; yet the
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:34484:105"/> Sweetneſs of the <hi>true</hi> may as well be diſtinguiſht from that of the <hi>falſe;</hi> as the Light of the Sun from the Light of a Torch. The one is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly finer than the other, and alſo as ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior to it in Strength. And therefore <hi>David</hi> does not only own, that the Light of GOD's Countenance <hi>put Gladneſs in his Heart, Pſal.</hi> 4.7; (which ſignifies it was no flaſhy, frothy ſort of Comfort, as dwelling in the <hi>Heart:</hi>) but he farther declares, that it put <hi>more</hi> Gladneſs in His Heart, than <hi>the Increaſe of Corn and Wine could do.</hi> That is, it produced in him an higher kind of Joy, than the greateſt abundance of the uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulleſt Bleſſings of this Life, could poſſibly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe. Which does more than intimate, that a particular and extraordinary Sweetneſs is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd in the true ſpiritual Comforts. And where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever this Sweetneſs comes in its Strength, it claps a <hi>ſeal</hi> upon the Conſcience (as I may ſay) war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranting it to be right; and by its fulneſs, and force bears down the Soul into a fiducial belief, that the Comforts which imprint it come down from Heaven. But having made <hi>Sweetneſs</hi> the firſt beatifying <hi>Property</hi> of true Comforts; to ſay more concerning it here would be ſuperflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous. Only this would be noted; that when the Religious are importunate in ſeeking and ſupplicating for <hi>the Light of</hi> GOD's <hi>Countenance</hi> (as we may obſerve they are in Scripture) they have greateſt <hi>Reaſon</hi> to be ſo: (and I heartily wiſh that all Men were ſo) for it is not only an Inſtrument, but the chiefeſt Inſtrument of raiſing divine Comforts in the Soul.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Laſt Mark</hi> of true Comforts, is <hi>their coming upon us when we are in a good ſtate;</hi> in a ſtate of <hi>Regeneracy,</hi> or <hi>Righteouſneſs.</hi> The truth
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:34484:106"/> is,<note n="*" place="margin">Mat. 15.26, 27.</note> they are the Childrens Bread, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhall not be given to Dogs, or impious Livers. <hi>They</hi> indeed eat of the <hi>Crumbs</hi> that fall from their Maſters Table. They ſhare largely in <hi>temporal</hi> Bleſſings, and in the common Uſe, or external Injoyment of <hi>many Spiritual</hi> ones. But as for true Comforts, they belong not to them, nor ſhall they partake of them. They may have Comforts that are <hi>like</hi> the true, but the <hi>real</hi> Conſolations of the SPIRIT fall not to their Lot. For as an excellent Man ſaid:<note n="†" place="margin">Fiat ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitia &amp; habebis pacem. <hi>Auguſt.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>divine Peace is an Appendix of Righteouſneſs.</hi> But they that travel in the Rode of Sin, are out of the way of true Comfort.</p>
               <p>Hence we may judge of the Quality of our Comforts, and be able to determine whether they are ſuch as they ought to be. How is it with our Souls? that's the Queſtion to be askt here. Are we in a <hi>righteous,</hi> or <hi>regenerate</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition? Have we mortifi'd our Luſts, and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>du'd our Corruptions? Have we repented of our Sins, and fully renounc'd them, and finally relinquiſht them? Do we honour and love GOD? and are we reſolv'd to do ſo with our whole Hearts, and through our whole Lives? And to come home to the point, is our Love to GOD expreſs'd in <hi>obeying</hi> Him, and is our Obedience <hi>faithful</hi> and undiſſembled? Then we may conclude that our Comforts are true. But inſtead of loving GOD, if we diſregard Him; inſtead of ſerving Him, if we diſobey Him; and do it conſtantly, or do it frequently, in any known inſtance: in all likelihood our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts muſt be falſe.</p>
               <pb n="199" facs="tcp:34484:106"/>
               <p>By this <hi>laſt</hi> Mark the truth of our Comforts may as well be tri'd, as by any of the reſt. Tho' our ſafeſt way will not be to truſt to one ſingly, (except the <hi>laſt</hi>) leſt we ſhould be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived. King <hi>Herod</hi> (as we obſerved) heard <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt <hi>gladly:</hi> and the People com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to the <hi>ſtony Ground,</hi> receiv'd the Seed of the Word <hi>with Joy.</hi> And ſo according to the <hi>firſt</hi> Mark, Both, (when their Comforts came upon them) were <hi>well imployed.</hi> And accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the <hi>ſecond</hi> Mark their Comforts flow'd from <hi>divine Objects.</hi> But for all that they were ſtill but counterfeit. The beſt and only way to be aſſured, they are genuine, is to find <hi>all</hi> theſe Marks upon them at once. And by thoſe <hi>Four</hi> which are here laid down, it will be eaſy to diſcern True Comforts from Falſe.</p>
               <p>We are next to conſider <hi>whence</hi> theſe <hi>falſe Comforts</hi> ſpring. And they iſſue from ſeveral Fountains.</p>

For by mingling its brisk acrimonious Flatulency with a ſweetiſh heavyiſh kind of Bloud; it ſtrikes upon the Nerves with ſuch grateful Touches, as cauſe delightful Titillations in the Body, and ſo affect the Soul with much <hi>joy</hi> and <hi>pleaſure.</hi> Nor need we wonder that ſuch joyous Comforts, or Delights, ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult from <hi>meer nature,</hi> or our bodily Temper; if we do but conſider how <hi>other things</hi> are very productive of the like Effects.</p>

Yet theſe are Fruits that may grow upon the bare ſtock of Nature; and ſo may have nothing at all of the Good SPI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RIT in them, or of His true Conſolati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> Inward Comforts, <hi>Falſe ones,</hi> I mean, may be Effects of a worſe Cauſe than this, they may be derived from <hi>Satan himſelf.</hi> As GOD ſheds abroad true Joys, and heavenly Conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions into the Hearts of His Servants, to encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage and ſtrengthen them in the Works of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion; ſo the Devil (who loves to ape the ALMIGHTY where he can) does ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times caſt falſe Joys and deluſive Comforts into the Hearts of his Vaſſals, to animate and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolden
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:34484:108"/> them in the Ways of unrighteouſneſs. For ſhould they always walk on in Dulneſs and Darkneſs, this might ſo ſtartle them, as to make them ſeriouſly bethink themſelves. It might ſo alarm and terrify them, as at ſome time or other to fright them out of their viti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, into virtuous Courſes. Now and then therefore he tantalizes them with ſome feeble Glimmerings of falſe Light and Comfort. He darts ſome glaring Joys into their Souls, to make them well opinion'd of themſelves. And perſwading them by this means that their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition is good (tho' it be quite otherwiſe) he ſo prevails with them to perſiſt in Sin, till at length they fall into irrecoverable Ruine.</p>
               <p>Nor is it hard to conceive <hi>how</hi> the Evil Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit ſhould kindle this Fire of falſe Joys in our Breaſts, and warm us as it were with Comforts which flaſh from Hell. For ſince an agreeable mixture of Melancholy with our Bloud, can raiſe us as we have heard, to an Elevation of rapturous Delights: the Devil who hath power to actuate the Humors and Vapours in our Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies (eſpecially if we be his Servants) by his dexterous agitation of thoſe Vapours and Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors (inforcing them beyond their natural ſtrength) he may eaſily tranſport us with ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſhing Satisfactions. And thus the ſtrange Delights which ſome Men feel, and which they reckon to be divine Influences from above, and bleſſed Productions of the HOLY GHOST; are but <hi>natural</hi> Effects, or <hi>Satanical</hi> Injections: and ſo rather helliſh Infuſions, than Inſpirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons from Heaven.</p>
               <pb n="203" facs="tcp:34484:108"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Falſe Comforts may proceed from <hi>Enthuſiaſm.</hi> For where that prevails, Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is ſtrong. Inſomuch that the Mind, which ſhould always be under the government of free Reaſon, is wholly ſway'd by this lower Faculty. And where Fancy rules, it eaſily over-powers and bears down the Soul into a firm Belief of the Truth of what ſhe vigorouſly apprehends; be her Apprehenſions never ſo enormous and extravagant. Hence it hath come to paſs, that one Fanciful Enthuſiaſt has conceited himſelf to be a Prophet, or an Angel; another has thought himſelf to be the true Meſſiah, or the great Judge of the World; another has boaſted him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to be GOD the FATHER, or the HOLY GHOST. Now when the Strength of Fancy, or Force of Imagination, thus carries away the Mind into a credulous Aſſent to ſuch wretched Miſ-conceits, theſe, or the like Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits, naturally lift up Souls (which fully be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve them to be great Truths) into very high Joys and Raviſhments of Spirit. Yet be they never ſo lofty, or never ſo luſcious, they are but a corrupt and dangerous ſort of Fruit, as having nothing but <hi>Enthuſiaſm</hi> for their chiefeſt Root.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Falſe Comforts may ariſe from <hi>wrong Notions which Men have in Divinity.</hi> Thus ſome<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> (too opinionative) are mightily for <hi>ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute</hi> or irreſpective <hi>Predeſtination.</hi> Others, for <hi>Juſtification</hi> by <hi>Faith alone.</hi> Others, for being juſtifi'd by CHRIST's <hi>Righteouſneſs imputed.</hi> And others again are as ſtiff Aſſertors, and as ſtrenuous Maintainers of that abſurd Perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, that GOD <hi>ſees no Sin in His own Children.</hi> Now they that firmly believe, and fiercely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:34484:109"/> for <hi>theſe,</hi> and <hi>ſuch</hi> Fancies; conclude they are highly beneficial to them, in their greateſt Intereſts: and ſo they are ſtrangely affected with them, and influenced by them, and feel them at times to be very pleaſing and gratify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing things. For when they ſeriouſly think they are ſo dear to GOD, as by His meer good Pleaſure to be from all Eternity <hi>pre-ordained</hi> to Life; while thouſands by Nature as worthy as themſelves, were ſadly <hi>paſs'd by,</hi> and <hi>excluded</hi> for ever from the happy State: O how ſoft and ſweet, and delicious are theſe Thoughts! Eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially when they go on to conſider farther, that the ſame GOD, if they <hi>believe</hi> in his SON, will reckon them <hi>juſt</hi> upon account of <hi>his</hi> Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs transferr'd to them; and tho' their Sins be <hi>great,</hi> for the ſake of that <hi>Righteouſneſs</hi> will graciouſly <hi>connive</hi> at them, or <hi>overlook</hi> them. This makes them ſwell with <hi>tumid Joys,</hi> and triumph in the ſenſe of <hi>inward Pleaſures:</hi> and ready to cry out, O happy, happy Creatures we! that drink ſo deep of GOD's Love and Favour: Yet all this while, there is no more <hi>genuine Comfort</hi> in their Joys, than there is of <hi>Truth</hi> in their erroneous <hi>Notions.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fifthly,</hi> Falſe Comforts may have their riſe, from <hi>Texts of Scripture miſtaken and miſappli'd.</hi> As a Specimen of theſe I mention but <hi>three. Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed are the merciful, for they ſhall obtain Mercy, Mat.</hi> 5.7. <hi>If we confeſs our ſins, he is faithful, and juſt to forgive us our ſins,</hi> 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.9. <hi>Who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever ſhall call upon the Name of the</hi> LORD, <hi>ſhall be ſaved, Rom.</hi> 10.13. Now too many heedleſs and unwary Chriſtians, greedily catch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at theſe excellent Paragraphs of the ſacred Word, and running away with them in a
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:34484:109"/> 
                  <hi>ſtrained ſenſe,</hi> and <hi>forc'd application</hi> of the ſame to themſelves; do confidently argue and inferr from them, that they are ſure to be bleſſed in <hi>Mercy,</hi> and <hi>Pardon,</hi> and <hi>eternal Salvation.</hi> For they <hi>give Alms,</hi> and make frequent <hi>Confeſſions</hi> of their Sins to GOD, and put up conſtant or cuſtomary <hi>Prayers</hi> to His MAJESEY. And being fairly intitled to ſuch precious <hi>Bleſſings</hi> (as they imagine) and directed by Scripture moſt juſtly to claim and challenge them for their <hi>own:</hi> they <hi>rejoice</hi> exceſſively in the Right they have to them. But alas, all this time they do but miſ-interpret, and vainly miſ-apply the holy Texts: and ſo whatever Comforts they extort from them, they cannot poſſibly be of the true Kind, nor yet of any good uſe or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence.</p>

               </argument>
               <p>ALL that hath been hitherto ſaid of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts, relates to thoſe in this <hi>preſent</hi> ſtate. And tho' they be very conſiderable both in their kind, and meaſures; yet they are the <hi>leaſt</hi> of them which holy Mourners may expect. For if they lift up the Eyes of their pure Minds, and look beyond this lower World; they ſhall ſee there are <hi>other</hi> divine Comforts in reſerve for them, and they many <hi>more,</hi> and much <hi>bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> than they here meet with: I mean the <hi>joys</hi> of the <hi>future</hi> Life.

                  <hi>A Tear is the ſeed of everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Joy.</hi> And O happy Creatures! who ſow plenty of ſuch Seed, as will ſpring up, and fructify to ſo bleſſed an Harveſt.</p>
               <p>The Prophet deſcribing true Repentance, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſeth it thus, <hi>Jer.</hi> 4.3. <hi>Break up your fallow ground.</hi> Which however it may ſeem a ruſtical Phraſe, yet the SPIRIT very often ſpeaking of Mens virtuous actions, by the metaphorical term of <hi>ſowing;</hi> it wants not a kind of Grace and Elegancy. And as many as in purſuance of that Direction, break up the <hi>fallow ground</hi> of their Hearts (which grant, O LORD, we may all do) and amongſt other good <hi>ſeed</hi> ſow ſtore of pious mournful <hi>Tears:</hi> they are ſure of the <hi>richeſt</hi> Crop they can deſire. For when they reap it, it ſhall be <hi>all Joys,</hi> and the Joys of <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven:</hi> which ſhall be as great as GOD can give, and as glorifi'd Saints in their reſpective Capacities can receive.</p>
               <p>And that <hi>future</hi> Joys muſt be <hi>great</hi> and <hi>excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent,</hi> we may juſtly inferr and certainly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude from the admirable <hi>Qualities</hi> of <hi>preſent</hi> ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Comforts. For tho' they be really ſuch as we have heard, yet the <hi>Joys above</hi> muſt needs <hi>excell</hi> them. For to rejoice <hi>there,</hi> will be part of the Saints Work, as well their Reward; and their bleſſed Imployment, as well as their Feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city.</p>
               <pb n="208" facs="tcp:34484:111"/>
               <p>Aſſure thy ſelf, Chriſtian, that the livelieſt, loftieſt, Comforts <hi>here,</hi> are but meer Shadows to thoſe Joys in the higher Regions. They are but as a Spark, to that glorious Flame; and as a little Drop, to that vaſt Ocean. He that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pares the Comforts of <hi>this</hi> Life, to the Joys of the <hi>next;</hi> hangs out a Candle to vie Light with the Sun, and weighs an Atome againſt a Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain. Tho' our preſent Comforts be moſt rare and precious things, our future Joys will much exceed them. We may view the great <hi>Difference</hi> betwixt them in <hi>Four Properties.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> Our future Joys will be <hi>immediate.</hi> They ſhall not be infus'd by the Miniſtery of Angels, nor yet excited by the Meditation of Duties, or Intervention of Ordinances: but ſhall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend directly from GOD Himſelf, from His propitious and moſt quickning Influence. The Sight of His Face, and the Senſe of His Love, and deep Apprehenſions of His divine Favour, without the Help of any other means, will cauſe them to riſe and ſwell within us. And therefore they are ſaid to be our <hi>Maſter's Joy,</hi> and <hi>the Joy of our</hi> LORD, <hi>Mat.</hi> 25.21, 23. Even becauſe they flow chiefly from an open and immediate fruition of GOD, and a ſweet and intimate communion with Him.</p>
               <p>It is not thus with our <hi>preſent</hi> Comforts. They are not to be had, but with Sweat and Pains, with much labour and religious Induſtry. We are fain to faſt and to pray, to weep and to mourn, to read and to meditate, and by all good Arts and holy Exerciſes to ſeek them earn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſtly, before we can find them. Nay perhaps all we can do, will not ſometimes procure
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:34484:111"/> them at laſt. For poſſibly our <hi>Sins</hi> may offend our GOD, and force him to ſtand at a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance from us. Or it may be He ſees our <hi>Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions</hi> to be ſuch, that He durſt not ſhed down Comforts upon us, leſt we ſhould wax looſe and wanton under them; and ſo inſtead of kindneſſes, they ſhould prove occaſions of ruine to our Souls.</p>
               <p>But in Heaven it ſhall be otherwiſe. As we ſhall there be fit to receive great Joys, ſo GOD will be ready to impart the ſame; and nothing between us ſhall intercept and hinder their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcent upon us, or render them more flat, or leſs pleaſing to us.</p>
               <p>This is the <hi>firſt</hi> excellent Property of future Joys. They are derived <hi>immediately</hi> from GOD Himſelf, and pour'd into our Hearts by His ſacred Hands. And in this regard they far ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed our preſent Comforts. For when <hi>they</hi> come moſt directly of all, there are ſome things or other which bring them to us, or work them in us, as the HOLY GHOST makes them inſtrumental to produce them. And tho' this does not make our Comforts at all impure, yet it renders them the more imperfect.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> Our future Joys will be <hi>ſincere.</hi> There ſhall be no ſadneſs, or bitterneſs intermixed with them. This Property is an inſeparable conſequent of the former. For Joys Immediate, muſt needs be ſimple, and unſophiſticate. Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding from GOD ſolely, they muſt be ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere: for what Compoſition can they bring from Him, whoſe Perfection it is to have none in Himſelf?</p>
               <pb n="210" facs="tcp:34484:112"/>
               <p>Our <hi>preſent</hi> Comforts are not ſuch. Here our fineſt Gold is mingled with Droſs, and our pureſt Grain is blended with Chaff. Our whiteſt Flour hath its Bran, and our ſweeteſt Roſes have their Pricks. Our higheſt Pleaſures go off with Pain, and our ſtrongeſt Delights have ſomewhat <hi>in</hi> them, or ſomewhat <hi>with</hi> them that damps or weakens them.</p>
               <p>But in Heaven our Joys ſhall be pure and defaecate. There ſhall be Light without Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and Peace without Trouble. Mirth with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Heavineſs, and Eaſe without Affliction. Happineſs without Care, and Pleaſure without Complaint, or the leaſt Lamentation. There's nothing there to ſtop, nothing to trouble the Torrent of our Satisfactions; but the deep and mighty Streams of Joy, run on with undiſturbed Smoothneſs, as well as with undefiled Clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
               <p>This is the <hi>Second</hi> excellent Property of future Joys. They are <hi>ſimple</hi> and <hi>ſincere;</hi> ſublimated and refin'd from all droſſy Mixtures. Not clogg'd, not ſtain'd, not toucht with any dilu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting or diminiſhing Adherencies. And upon this account they far exceed our preſent Comforts. For when they are moſt divinely bright and ſweet, there is ſtill ſome Cloudineſs, or Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſineſs <hi>in</hi> them, or ſoon <hi>after</hi> them. Yea, GOD, many times is conſtrain'd to daſh and allay our Comforts, leſt by being too ſtrong, they ſhould prove injurious. Thus Numbers in the Church are ſo unhappy in Weakneſs, Gid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dineſs, and Levity; that were they favoured with plenty of high Conſolations, they would be ſo puft up with the valuable Privilege, as to be very unſeemly, if not ſinfully tranſported.</p>
               <pb n="211" facs="tcp:34484:112"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Our future Joys will be <hi>Satisfactory.</hi> In GOD's <hi>Preſence</hi> (His <hi>glorious</hi> Preſence) <hi>there is Fulneſs of Joy, Pſal.</hi> 16.11. A compleat Satiety of heavenly Contentment. An immenſe, and alſo an entire Felicity. A Sea of Delights, where the moſt inlarged Appetites may not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fill themſelves up to the Brim; but ſink and drown as it were, in boundleſs and bottomleſs Gratifications.</p>
               <p>Our <hi>preſent</hi> Comforts are not of this ſort. Comparatively they are ſlight and <hi>ſhrivell'd</hi> things rather; and of a very narrow and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted nature. When they are ſhed down moſt copiouſly upon us, they leave huge Chaſms and Vacuities in us. They are ſo far from ſatiating the Soul, that when ſhe drinks deepeſt of them, ſhe thirſts after more: and the freeſt Draughts that ever ſhe takes, do rather inflame, than fill her Deſires. And they that always burn with deſires after more Joys than here they have; ſufficiently prove that the greateſt they feel are not big enough for them.</p>
               <p>But in Heaven there's a Plenitude of divine Joys. Such a perfect and abſolute Fulneſs of them, as is every way commenſurate to our vaſt Capacities. Such as will eaſily ſupply all our Neceſſities, and alſo entertain all our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties, and likewiſe anſwer all our Expectan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, even beyond whatever we can think or wiſh. And ſo we ſhall not be able to ſay, we <hi>want</hi> this, or we <hi>would have</hi> that, becauſe we ſhall have more than we can need or long for, in the Joys we ſhall poſſeſs.

               <pb n="212" facs="tcp:34484:113"/>
               <p>Now one great Reaſon why our future Joys are ſo throughly <hi>ſatisfying;</hi> is becauſe they are ſo very <hi>ſuitable.</hi> Otherwiſe they could never be ſatisfactory to us, tho' moſt Excellent. They ſhall not be groſs and ſenſual indeed; but then for <hi>that</hi> they will not be the leſs, but the more ſuitable. For being of a fine and <hi>ſpiritual</hi> Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, they muſt be the more agreeable to humane <hi>Souls,</hi> becauſe <hi>they</hi> are of the like Nature. And ſo carnal Pleaſures, and ſecular Things can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſatisfy them, in regard they are of a ſpiritual Subſtance. For that Reaſon the Soul can no more be ſatisfi'd with Gold and Silver, with Houſes and Lands, with Dignities and Honours, and the Delights of Senſe; than our Barns can be filled with Virtue; or our Baggs, with Grace; or our Coffers, with Godlineſs. Could any Man improve his Eſtate to a Kingdom; and then raiſe that Kingdom to an Empire; and then make that Empire univerſal, extend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it over the whole World; and ſo intitle Himſelf to all earthly Power and Pleaſure: yet his Soul could no more be ſatisfi'd therewith, than his Body can be fed and nouriſht with Wind. For betwixt the Soul and the World; betwixt ſpiritual Deſires, and material Objects; betwixt divine and lofty Appetites; and low, and ſordid, and ignoble Gratifications: there is no manner of parity or congruity. But there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Joys we ſpeak of are ſpiritual, and ſo exactly ſuitable, and ſo compleatly ſatisfying, their Suitableneſs being joyned with abundant <hi>Fulneſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is the <hi>Third</hi> excellent Property of future Joys. They reach even to our real, thorough ſatisfaction. They fill us ſo as perfectly, to
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:34484:113"/> quiet us. So as to leave us no Needs <hi>of,</hi> or Cravings <hi>for</hi> more than we poſſeſs; nor yet any Emptineſs, whereby they ſhould be cauſed. And here again they far exceed our <hi>preſent</hi> Comforts. They never did, nor can ſo abound, as <hi>through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> to ſatisfy any Soul. When in greateſt mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures they reſt upon us, we are capable of greater, and reach after them as deſirous to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive them. They may be highly uſeful and beneficial to us (as hath been ſhewed) but ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfy us they cannot; they were never deſigned to that End. They are ſpiritual indeed, and ſo ſuitable enough; but they are ſhort of that Sufficiency which ſhould render them ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factory. Where the Fire is too little, we may ſtill be cold by it, tho' it be of an heating Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Our future Joys will be <hi>Eternal.</hi> As in GOD's Preſence there is <hi>Fulneſs</hi> of Joy; ſo <hi>at His right Hand there are</hi> Pleaſures for ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 16.11. Not for days or weeks, or months, or years, or ages; but for ever and ever. As in Righteous perſons, the hatred of Sin, and the practice of Virtue, had they lived for ever, would have been endleſs: ſo after their Death, and the final Judgment, their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munerative Joys ſhall be as durable.</p>
               <p>Our <hi>preſent</hi> Comforts are nothing like them. They are flitting and tranſient, and of very ſhort and momentany continuance. When at any time they flow up to an high Tide, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adventure by and by they ebb or fall as faſt, and 'tis preſently low Water with them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain.</p>
               <p>But in Heaven the Joys are long enough, as being of no leſs than infinite Duration. As
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:34484:114"/> they are ſo conſtant as to know no Intermiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; ſo they are ſo permanent as to have no Expiration. As they have GOD for their Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, and Fulneſs for their Meaſure, and Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction for their Effect, and Happineſs for their End; ſo the only Boundary or Limit of their Exiſtence, is that which hath none at all in it ſelf, namely, <hi>Eternity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is the <hi>Fourth</hi> excellent Property of fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Joys. When they have endured Hundreds, Thouſands, Millions of Years, they are never the nearer, to an end, for having run on ſo far from their beginning. So long as <hi>we</hi> abide with GOD, ſo long will <hi>they</hi> abide with <hi>us;</hi> and we <hi>ſhall be for ever with the</hi> LORD, 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 4.7. And in this reſpect laſtly, they far exceed our <hi>preſent</hi> Comforts. For they at beſt are but fickle, aguiſh, and intermittent. They come by fits, and they leave us at times; now they recede, and then they return: and all that we can do will not ſtay their Lability, or Slipperineſs, and work them to a conſtant Settlement or Fixation. The beſt upon Earth are at no certainty at all for their Comforts: When they count them ſureſt, they may ſooneſt ſlip from them. They that have longeſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed them, muſt not think to hold them by Cuſtom; for in Spirituals there is no ſuch te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nure as <hi>Preſcription.</hi> Nor indeed is it fit that Comforts here, ſhould continue always at their Heighth; for then we ſhould be ſwallowed up entirely by them, and be able to do nothing elſe but injoy them.</p>
               <p>Such are the Joys of the World to come, and impoſſible it is there ſhould be Sweeter, or Bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. If therefore we be but ſo good as to love
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:34484:114"/> GOD, or elſe but ſo wiſe as to love our ſelves; what Courſe would we not willingly take to procure them? What would we not <hi>do,</hi> or what would we not <hi>be?</hi> What would we not <hi>ſuffer,</hi> or what would we not <hi>give,</hi> that ſo we might at laſt obtain and poſſeſs them? And conſequently if we be but ſo much Chriſtians, as to believe the great Truths which came down from Heaven, and this for one, that <hi>Holy Mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> gives a ſpecial <hi>Right</hi> to theſe excellent <hi>Joys;</hi> that Faith will not fail to draw us to the Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe, and that with ſuch Attraction as cannot be reſiſted. And to enſure ſuch matchleſs Joys as theſe, few methinks ſhould be loth to ſhed their <hi>Bloud;</hi> but none ſhould refuſe to ſhed their <hi>Tears.</hi>

               <head>CHAP. XVIII.</head>
               <argument>
                  <p>The <hi>Thirteenth Motive</hi> to Mourning in Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral; <hi>It hath been conſtantly practis'd in the Church of GOD,</hi> and is <hi>highly conducive to its Happineſs.</hi>
                  </p>
               </argument>
               <p>WHat is our Duty (as we have ſeen <hi>Holy Mourning</hi> is) and what makes for our Intereſt (as we have ſeen that does) were there none that ever acted it before us, and none that would ever ingage in it after us; we ſhould yet have great Reaſon to cloſe with it. But then to Mourn piouſly, we have <hi>greater</hi> Reaſon ſtill; becauſe as 'tis a Duty which ſerves our beſt Intereſts, ſo it hath been of <hi>conſtant</hi> and <hi>catholic</hi> uſe amongſt them that were good. At all times and in all places where true Religion hath been heartily received, <hi>that</hi> hath been ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken up, and ſeriouſly exercis'd by its choiceſt Profeſſors. Beſides plenty of Inſtances proving as much, the many Helps to it on Heaven's part, and the mighty Occaſions for it on ours; ſufficiently argue that it could not be wanting, where GOD was well worſhipt. So that if we mean to conform to the beſt (as all indeed are oblig'd to do) how can we avoid Religious Mourning? And truly why ſhould we, when the moſt excellent Perſons that the World ever had, have <hi>practis'd</hi> it as a thing moſt neceſſary and uſeful? And if it were needful and bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial to <hi>them,</hi> why ſhould it not be the ſame to <hi>us;</hi> who have no reaſon to think we are bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than they, or that we need it leſs?</p>
               <pb n="217" facs="tcp:34484:115"/>
               <p>But here I muſt add; that it is not only uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and advantageous to <hi>our ſelves</hi> in our private Capacities, but alſo to the <hi>Militant Church</hi> in General; and will miniſter to its Happineſs with a mighty Efficacy, where we ſet it a work to that purpoſe. For Holy Mourning, as we have ſhew'd, is<note n="*" place="margin">Chap. 5.</note> moſt <hi>acceptable</hi> to GOD: and ſo in conjunction with that Body of Duties which belong to Chriſtianity muſt needs be eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable and prevalent with Him upon great Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts, in reference to His Church, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce very much to the felicity of it.</p>
               <p>We'll remark its Efficacy, and how mightily it prevails, when united with <hi>one</hi> great Duty only, that of <hi>Prayer.</hi> Suppoſe then the Church be oppreſs'd with Enemies, and we <hi>pray</hi> for Her deliverance: let us but join <hi>Mourning</hi> with our Supplication, and ſo it will become more powerful and effectual. King <hi>David</hi> ſeems to warrant this. For when the <hi>Church</hi>'s Enemies and <hi>His</hi> grew rampant and troubleſome, he did not only <hi>call</hi> upon GOD for deliverance, but joined <hi>Mourning</hi> with his Invocation. And for that reaſon he had the better Title to GOD's Attention, and His gracious Anſwer, as we may gather from <hi>Pſal.</hi> 55.2. <hi>Take heed unto me, and hear me, how I</hi> mourn <hi>in my Prayer.</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he did not only <hi>pray</hi> for Deliverance, but <hi>mourn</hi> in His Prayer; he put a ſpecial Emphaſis, and laid a particular Streſs upon <hi>that,</hi> and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected to be heard the ſooner for it. And ſo he was, as in another place he gives us to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand. For when againſt ſuch Enemies as now were mentioned, he had <hi>prayed</hi> and <hi>wept;</hi> they were immediately to be <hi>checkt</hi> and <hi>repell'd. The</hi> LORD <hi>hath heard the voice of my</hi> Weep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:34484:116"/> 
                  <hi>the</hi> LORD <hi>hath heard my</hi> Petition; <hi>the</hi> LORD <hi>will receive my</hi> Prayer. <hi>All mine Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies ſhall be</hi> confounded <hi>and ſore</hi> vexed; <hi>they ſhall be</hi> turned back, <hi>and put to</hi> ſhame <hi>ſuddenly, Pſal.</hi> 6.8, 9, 10. No ſooner had he poured out his Prayers with <hi>tears,</hi> but GOD was ready to appear againſt the Adverſaries, whoſe Malice he deprecated. They were to be diſſipated, and he delivered ſuddenly;<note n="*" place="margin">

And truly if zealous Chriſtians would ſpend their Fervency in mournful Prayers for the like Bleſſing; the Church would be in a fair way to obtain it. For <hi>Chriſtians</hi> Tears would be as prevailing for <hi>their</hi> Church, as this <hi>Hebrew</hi> Prince's were for the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> one. So prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that Deliverance would not fail, in GOD's time, to follow them; even Deliverance from the worſt of all their Adverſaries. Then were their Numbers never ſo great, and their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federacies never ſo ſtrong; were their Forces never ſo mighty, and their Policies never ſo crafty; were their Plots never ſo deep, and their Malice never ſo high, and their Machi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations never ſo dangerous: Providence, when beſt, would reſcue Her from them all. And which is more, would <hi>expedite</hi> or <hi>haſten</hi> that reſcue too; delivering Her <hi>ſpeedily,</hi> by <hi>turning back,</hi> and <hi>confounding</hi> Her Enemies <hi>ſuddenly,</hi> as the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> ſpeaks. And would not this be a ſingular piece of Felicity?</p>
               <p>But then (to go on) Holy Mourning in conjunction with Prayer, will ſerve as well to lift the Church up to an <hi>higher ſort</hi> of Happineſs: into a State of <hi>extraordinary</hi> Purity and Proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:34484:116"/> 
                  <hi>Our</hi> Condition <hi>now,</hi> is not unlike to that of the <hi>Jews</hi> juſt before our SAVIOUR's coming in the Fleſh. They at that Time were big with Hopes and great Expectations of a <hi>new Scene</hi> of things: of entring on another and much better State than that they were in. Which the<note n="*" place="margin">Luk. 2.25, 38.</note> Evangeliſt call'd a <hi>Looking for the Redemption,</hi> and a <hi>Waiting for the Conſolation of</hi> Iſrael. And tho' they had a <hi>wrong Notion</hi> of the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> and His Kingdom; they were <hi>right</hi> as to <hi>expecting</hi> His Advent in that Juncture. We, I ſay, are now ſo far in their circumſtance, that we are pregnant with <hi>hope,</hi> and (as we are ready to think) with <hi>well grounded</hi> Expectancy of the true Church's <hi>Exaltation</hi> upon Earth. Of her Exaltation of ſo glorious a Pitch, as ſhe never yet reacht to. So that were <hi>Mournful Prayer</hi> but here well imploy'd, it might proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly <hi>ſpeed</hi> this Her happy Advancement, and be a means to bring it the <hi>ſooner</hi> about. What, ſays<note n="†" place="margin">Ja. 5.16.</note> S. <hi>James</hi> of the fervent Prayer of a righteous Man? it <hi>availeth much.</hi> But if the ſingle Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of <hi>one</hi> righteous importunate Supplicant, be of ſuch force; what need we <hi>want,</hi> or what Bleſſing could GOD think too <hi>good</hi> for us, would we all be a righteous and praying Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple? Eſpecially if to Praying we would add holy <hi>Mourning.</hi> For that does by Prayer, as one Figure does by another before it; raiſe its Value, and make it ten times greater than it was alone. Join but holy <hi>Tears</hi> then with fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent Prayer, and I had almoſt ſaid, we may do any thing with eaſe. Then we may not only vanquiſh Hell, but bring down Heaven into the Church on Earth: for upon our Knees we may uſe an holy Violence with good ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs.
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:34484:117"/> And when we may be ſo helpful in this bleſſed Work, ſhall we not aſſiſt ſo far as we are able? In caſe we will not, know that GOD can do it <hi>without</hi> us: tho' <hi>that</hi> methinks ſhould be leſs ſatisfaction to us. For ſhould we live to ſee it happily effected, and be conſcious that <hi>we</hi> did not duly forward it; would not this very greatly afflict us? When we ſhall find it done by the Great GOD in His <hi>own Way,</hi> and <hi>to</hi> His own <hi>Ends;</hi> and ſhall find withall, that we did not devoutly <hi>act</hi> our Parts in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to it: muſt not this trouble us, and take off much of the ſweetneſs of the Mercy, when we come to ſhare in it? Upon this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count what ſerious Chriſtians would not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately turn holy Mourners? And then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides; we have often and greatly <hi>injur'd</hi> the Church: and ſo in way of <hi>compenſation,</hi> or the beſt <hi>requital</hi> that we can make her, we ought ſo to mourn, as to the beſt of our power to promote her Happineſs. I do not ſay we have injured the Church as <hi>ſome</hi> have done. For I hope (generally ſpeaking) we were never ſo violent in <hi>our ſelves,</hi> or ſo cruel to <hi>them,</hi> as to perſecute any of its faithful Members. We ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver hamper'd them with Bonds, or hal'd them to Priſons, or breath'd out Threatnings and Slaughters againſt them. We never whetted our Knives to cut their Throats, nor drew our Swords to ſtab them to the Heart, nor kindled Fires to burn them at the Stake. But yet we have too much contributed to the Churches Miſchief. As by <hi>Faction,</hi> it may be, or <hi>Schiſm,</hi> by <hi>Diſſention,</hi> or <hi>Diviſion,</hi> by <hi>Ungovernableneſs,</hi> or <hi>Rebellion.</hi> Or if GOD hath reſtrain'd us from theſe ſad Exorbitancies, yet ſtill we have

               <p>And whatever in this way we do for the Church, we may conclude Her extremely <hi>worthy</hi> of it. For the true Chriſtian Church is a Community of the beſt People in the World. A Fraternity of virtuous and religious Perſons. A Society of innocent and holy Livers, that believe and act the nobleſt things.

And how deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable ſoever they may now <hi>ſeem,</hi> and however vilifi'd and abuſed they may <hi>be;</hi> yet over a while the LORD JESUS will dignify them with ſuch high Perfections, and veſt them with ſuch bright and radiant Splendors, as will render them incomparably glorious and admirable, even in the Eyes of all beholders. He ſignifies no leſs where He openly declares, that at His Second event, He ſhall <hi>come to be glorifi'd in his Saints, and to be admir'd in all them that believe,</hi> 2 Theſſ. 1.10.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Objections</hi> againſt Holy Mourning anſwered; as that 'tis <hi>beneath us.</hi> Makes us <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy. Diſparages Religion. Waſtes our Time.</hi> And <hi>hinders Buſineſs.</hi>
                  </p>
               </argument>
               <p>HAving done with the <hi>Motives</hi> which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vite to <hi>Holy Mourning</hi> in <hi>General</hi> (and may they effectually induce us to it:) 'twill be proper in the next place, to ſee what <hi>Objections</hi> may be brought againſt it, and to remove them fairly out of the way.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Firſt</hi> may be this; <hi>Mourning is a thing very much beneath us.</hi> Below our Nature and our Dignity. Man is no leſs than a marvellous Compound of different Principles. And tho' his Body be as mean and faeculent, as the Earth he treads on; being originally made out of it, and ſo ſymbolical and homogeneous with it: yet his Soul is a divine and noble Eſſence; im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>material and ſpiritual, equal to Angels, and like unto GOD. And in this reſpect he is highly advanc'd in the Claſſis or Scale of living Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and indu'd and adorn'd with ſuch Facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and Perfections, as are ſuitable to a Being of his Rank or Station in the animate World.</p>
               <p>Nor was his Original <hi>Dignity</hi> ſhort of his <hi>Frame</hi> or <hi>Nature.</hi> For when GOD created Him, his Favour beſtow'd the high Privilege upon him; to make him <hi>Prince</hi> or <hi>Head</hi> of this ſublunary World, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1.28. And for Him that is of ſo high a Nature, and alſo bears ſo high a Character; <hi>Mourning</hi> muſt needs be too
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:34484:120"/> 
                  <hi>low</hi> an Exerciſe. When his <hi>Perſon</hi> is ſo extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary, as to excell even all the viſible Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and his <hi>Power</hi> ſo eminent, as at firſt to hold the Reins of this World in his hand; for him to ſit whimpering with Tears in his Eyes, will ill become ſo exalted a Creature, and the Empire delegated to him from above.</p>
               <p>To this I anſwer.</p>
               <p>Firſt, Grief is one of our <hi>natural Paſſions.</hi> And whatever is a piece of Man's Nature, muſt not be counted either <hi>unworthy</hi> of him, or <hi>diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graceful</hi> to him. That would be a rude and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious reflection upon the All-wiſe and Glorious GOD who made Him.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Tho' Man in this inferior World, was, and in ſome meaſure, ſtill is a kind of <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign,</hi> yet <hi>he is one of the</hi> ALMIGHTY's <hi>Subjects.</hi> And ſo whatever Commands GOD lays upon him, he is bound indiſpenſably to obey them. And holy <hi>Mourning</hi> being one of his Precepts, in point of Duty he muſt ſubmit to that. And as that which is his Duty, will be ſo far from debaſing him, that 'twill conduce to his Honour as well as to his Intereſt; ſo holy Mourning (as being a Duty which GOD injoins) muſt improve his Nature, and imbel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh his Worth; and while it advances both, can diſparage neither.</p>
               <p>For this we have a Proof that puts the thing paſt all doubt. JESUS our LORD was once an holy Mourner upon Earth. He wept for <hi>Lazarus,</hi> St. <hi>Joh.</hi> 11.35. And in the days of His Fleſh, <hi>He offered up Prayers and Supplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions with ſtrong crying Tears, Heb.</hi> 5.7. But did
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:34484:120"/> this at all ſink or degrade our Nature, which He graciouſly aſſumed? So far from <hi>that,</hi> that at this very time (and for many Ages paſt) it ſits at GOD's Right hand in Glory, and is there exalted far above all Principality, and Power, and Might, and Dominion, and every Name that is named, not only in this World, but alſo in the next, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.21. So far is Mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from diſparaging <hi>our</hi> Nature, that GOD did not count it diſparaged <hi>His.</hi> For when our LORD wept, even <hi>He</hi> was concern'd in ſhed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding thoſe Tears, as being hypoſtatically joined to our Fleſh.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> It may be objected againſt holy Mourning, that <hi>it makes us Melancholy,</hi> or is a <hi>piece</hi> of that unhappy and uneaſy Temper. And ſo indeed it will not only be of no uſe, but of dangerous conſequence. For Melancholy is ſaid (and not improperly) to be <hi>the Devil's</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">Balneum Diaboll.</note> 
                  <hi>Bath.</hi> A complexion wherein our great Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary delights; as being troubleſom to <hi>us,</hi> and advantageous to him, in carrying on his Mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Deſigns againſt us. And when religious Mourning leads to Melancholy, or conſiſts of it; which is injurious to us: there's ſo little cauſe why we ſhould Mourn, that we have rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to neglect it, and induſtriouſly decline it; and to do all we can to defend our ſelves from it. I anſwer.</p>
               <p>This <hi>Charge</hi> of <hi>Melancholy</hi> upon holy Mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing runs too high, and ſeems to come from the unexperienc'd. Divine Love is the uſual ſource from whence that flows; and therefore it is light, and ſoft, and pleaſant; and does not too much fret nor grate the Spirit, with anxious and corroding Trouble. <hi>Rejoyce evermore,</hi> is
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:34484:121"/> 
                  <hi>S. Paul</hi>'s Direction to the <hi>Theſſalonians:</hi> which plainly ſhows, that Chriſtians may in ſome meaſure <hi>rejoyce</hi> even when they <hi>mourn.</hi> Other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe the Duties would be inconſiſtent, and Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven muſt require ſuch Performances as are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compatible. The Prophet alſo tells us, of GOD's <hi>reviving the hearts of the Contrite,</hi> Iſa. 57.15. Which is farther Aſſurance that the tears let fall in holy Mourning, GOD ſhall turn into Spiritual Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dials. When our Hearts are wounded with Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred compunction, He'l certainly chear us un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the ſame, by mingling Divine Conſolati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons with it. And where ever thoſe Conſolations dwell, there can be no room for any ſettled Melancholy Dejection. We have heard likewiſe from the Mouth of the HOLY GHOST; that they who <hi>ſow in Tears</hi> ſhall <hi>reap in Joy.</hi> And tho they receive not their whole Crop on Earth, yet their bleſſed Harveſt begins here, and pleaſant are the <hi>Firſt Fruits</hi> which they gather, even thoſe they gather, as I may ſay, in a rainy-day. For believe it, there's<note n="*" place="margin">Dulcio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res ſunt lachrymae ploran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tium, quam gaudia Theatro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum. <hi>Aug.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>more ſweetneſs,</hi> in or after a few Tears ſpent in Holy Mourning; than in all the empty frothy mirth which this World affords. Tho' in that Exerciſe we be diſguiſed as it were with ſeeming ſadneſs; yet under the vizard of that Grief which we wear upon our Faces; ſome degree of Joy may lie hid in our hearts. For real Joy is no ſuch Enemy <hi>to,</hi> nor does it ſtand at ſuch a Diſtance <hi>from</hi> Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Sorrow, as ſome imagine.<note n="†" place="margin">Res ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vera eſt verum gaudium.</note> 
                  <hi>True Joy is a</hi> grave, and ſerious, and <hi>ſevere</hi> thing: and often ſpreads briskly through our Souls, when they are in a Mourning frame. And there's Reaſon for it. For as godly Sorrow contracts and leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſens our Opinion of this World, and eclipſes
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:34484:121"/> the Beauties and Glories of it, wrapping them up in Darkneſs and a Cloud; ſo at the ſame time it ſets a Luſtre on divine Excellencies, and quickens and dilates our Apprehenſions of them, and renders them very eſtimable with us. Yea, it draws aſide the Curtain betwixt GOD and us, and opens a Window towards Heaven for us, letting in the Light of his Countenance up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us, and the refreſhing Gleams of His raviſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Love: under the bright diſplays, and lively ſenſe of which, we cannot but rejoice even when holy Tears trickle down our Cheeks. In a word, our ſolemn Mournings and our ſacred Comforts are ſeldom <hi>far</hi> or <hi>long</hi> aſunder. But in caſe they be not actually Blended, or in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent meaſures happily complicated or twin'd together; then at little intervals or diſtances they will not fail by alternate Viciſſitudes to ſucceed each other.</p>
               <p>Whoever therefore make a laſting uneaſy Grief an Ingredient into ſacred Mourning; or think it compounded of harſh, vexatious, raking <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy:</hi> do but calumniate and reproach it, and declare themſelves Perfect ſtrangers to it. For did they but throughly underſtand the Duty, by being practically acquainted with it, they could never paſs ſuch a Cenſure upon it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> It may be objected againſt holy Mourning, that <hi>it diſparages Religion.</hi> Of ſuch a Conſtitution is true Chriſtianity, and ſo cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtantiated; that wherever it is heartily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd and practis'd, it will commonly be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductive of divine Tranquility, and a ſolemn Chearfulneſs. For,</p>
               <p n="1">1ſt, It reſtrains from all wilful Sins. And ſo it ſaves us from thoſe troubles both of Mind,
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:34484:122"/> and Body, which naturally and judicially pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue ſuch Impieties.</p>
               <p n="2">2ly. It fits us to be GOD's Habitations, and conſecrates us into Temples for the HOLY GHOST. And where GOD and His SPI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RIT are pleaſed to reſide, what chearfulneſs may not their Preſence produce?</p>
               <p n="3">3ly, <hi>Two</hi> chief <hi>Perfections</hi> of the Chriſtian Religion are <hi>Patience</hi> and <hi>Contentedneſs.</hi> And they that are furniſht with thoſe excellent Graces, are not only fortifi'd againſt Perplexity; but fairly diſpoſed to an Heavenly Lightſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
               <p n="4">4ly, <hi>Two</hi> ſpecial <hi>Fruits</hi> of the Bleſſed SPI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RIT, which uſually grow where Religion thrives; are <hi>Peace</hi> and <hi>Joy, Gal.</hi> 5.22. And what Souls can be ſad, where they flouriſh?</p>
               <p n="5">5ly. As the HOLY JESUS, by a princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal Apoſtle, hath given it in charge to all His true Proſelytes ever to <hi>rejoice in Him;</hi> and to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geminate the Precept, to inforce the Duty; <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joice in the</hi> LORD <hi>alway, and again I ſay, rejoice:</hi> So one great End why the holieſt Order of Men in His Church, was at firſt ſet up, and ever ſince continu'd; was that they might be <hi>helpers of His Peoples Joy,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.24.</p>
               <p>So that put theſe ſeveral things together, and impoſſible it is but Chriſtianity muſt miniſter to <hi>Peace</hi> and <hi>Joy:</hi> or rather in part be <hi>made up</hi> of the ſame. But then if it be thus, how very inagreeable and diſparaging to it, muſt <hi>Mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> be? And therefore why do you preſs it at ſuch a rate? For ſo earneſtly do you urge it, and ſo vehemently do you labour to perſwade us to it; as if you would have us all turn <hi>Hera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clitus</hi>'s, and ſpend our Days in penſive Sadneſs.
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:34484:122"/> As if we were forthwith to betake us to mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh Cells, to cloiſter up our ſelves in Darkneſs and Solitarineſs, and to keep the Muffler of Grief continually on our Faces. Or, in one Word, as if none could be happy but they whoſe cheeks are furrowed with their Tears, and whoſe handcherchiefs are never from their dripping Eyes. If this be a neceſſary Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an <hi>Duty,</hi> 'tis a very comfortleſs one; and will little <hi>credit</hi> it, or encourage any to undertake it. Nay to ſpeak the plain Truth, it ſeems to croſs it, and to be directly oppoſite to the very Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per or Genius of it.</p>
               <p>I anſwer.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Objection</hi> is <hi>perverſe</hi> and <hi>captious.</hi> There is a <hi>ſeaſon</hi> for every thing, as the great Maſter of Wiſdom obſerved, <hi>Eccles.</hi> 3.1. And amongſt the reſt, there's <hi>a time to weep, and a time to mourn:</hi> and that's my meaning, and all that I contend for. Now and then we ſhould weep and mourn, but not ſet our ſelves to do nothing elſe. To do that inceſſantly is the <hi>Damned's</hi> Fate, and would ill become the Children of GOD. Yet to Mourn <hi>at times</hi> will make us <hi>Bleſſed,</hi> as moſt of what hath been here advanc'd may ſerve to prove. But then that which helps to make us Bleſſed, as it can never blemiſh our Perſons in the leaſt; ſo neither can it give any <hi>diſrepute</hi> to that noble <hi>Religion</hi> whereof it is a Branch.</p>
               <p>Some are ready to think, and venture to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm, <hi>there ſhall be godly ſorrow in Heaven.</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">See Mr. <hi>Manton</hi>'s Expoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on on <hi>James</hi> 4th. v. 9th.</note> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <hi>there will be memory, and remembrance of ſins in Heaven, and becauſe 'tis rather a perfection, than an oppreſſion of Nature.</hi> And that which we are
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:34484:123"/> to do in Heaven, cannot <hi>diſparage</hi> our Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion upon Earth. But away with ſuch vain and wild diſcourſe; to talk of Mourning in the Regions of Bliſs, ſeems very extravagant. We there enter into our Maſters Joy, and that's too pure, and too ſublime, to be tinctur'd and allay'd with any kind of heavineſs. A Mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſtrain becomes us <hi>here,</hi> and let us be ſure to keep to it at times: but in the Conſort a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove it makes no Muſic, and therefore ſhall <hi>there</hi> be laid aſide. And well it may; for what kind of Melody can Mourning yield, where every Voice in the ſacred Quire, ſhall be wholly tun'd to the triumphant Key? All the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of the glorious Manſions, have everlaſting Joy upon their Heads; and as for Grief (even that of holy Mourning it ſelf) it ſhall utterly and eternally flee away. Tho' holy Sorrow here, be capable of ſome mixture of ſpiritual Joy (of enough to exclude all Melancholy from it:) yet the Joys above are too great and high to admit the leaſt meaſure of pious Mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. The better may we here take it up for a while, becauſe there it ſhall ceaſe for ever and ever. Troubles ſhall then be driven from our Hearts, and Tears ſhall then be wiped from our Eyes, and no manner of Complaints ſhall be heard amongſt us.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> It may be objected againſt holy Mourning, that <hi>it waſtes our Time.</hi> But the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection is frivolous, and of little weight. Time we muſt allow is a thing moſt precious; and GOD hath taught us ſo, by His way of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſing it. For He gives it us ſucceſſively <hi>one moment after another;</hi> and all the Wealth and Power in the World, cannot purchaſe two Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutes
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:34484:123"/> of it together. But How ſhould Mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>waſte</hi> our Time? All that we ſtand for, is but <hi>one day</hi> in a <hi>Month;</hi> and is not that a moſt reaſonable and moderate Expence? Who a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt us do not imbezil more Time in ſuch a Space; or needleſsly lay it out upon much lower, or leſs worthy things? Tho' ſhould we ſpend a great deal more time in Mourning than what's here mention'd; we ſhould be ſo far from <hi>waſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> it, that 'twould be hard to ſay how we ſhould better <hi>imploy,</hi> or ſo well <hi>improve</hi> it. Nor indeed is it eaſy to think of any way, whereby more effectually to <hi>Redeem</hi> that time we have already loſt. And this renders the Objection weaker ſtill.</p>
               <p>Alas, there's ſo little hazard of ſpending <hi>too much</hi> time in holy Mourning, that the danger lies quite on the other ſide, that we ſhould ſpend <hi>too little.</hi> And truly ſhould any of us be more frequent in it, than is here inſiſted on; yet when we die, or give up our laſt and great Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count (as we certainly muſt, and quickly may;) we ſhall never think that time waſted, which we ſo beſtowed; but ſhall blame our ſelves ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for devoting no more time to the advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geous Exerciſe. In our Chriſtian Duties, we may eaſily <hi>fall ſhort,</hi> and ſo miſs of Happineſs; but the Complaint of <hi>over-acting</hi> in ſuch inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, lies heavy upon none in the future ſtate. And particularly we need not dread that ever we ſhall there be offended with our ſelves, for being too <hi>much,</hi> or for being <hi>too</hi> often in this ſerious Work.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Laſtly,</hi> It may be objected againſt holy Mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that <hi>it hinders Buſineſs.</hi> But this Objection is as trifling as the former. For as the Chriſtian
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:34484:124"/> is made up of two ſorts of <hi>ſubſtances,</hi> the one Bodily, and the other Spiritual; and as he is related to two ſorts of <hi>Worlds,</hi> the one Earthly, and the other Coeleſtial; and as he is concerned in two ſorts of <hi>Intereſts,</hi> the one Temporal, and the other Eternal: ſo in his hands he hath two ſorts of <hi>Buſineſs,</hi> the one Secular, and the other Religious. But then the Buſineſs of Religion being infinitely more uſeful than that of the World; if in favour of the <hi>former,</hi> the <hi>latter</hi> be ſometimes a little neglected, this will be far from an <hi>hindrance</hi> of <hi>Buſineſs;</hi> inaſmuch as by reaſon of this very neglect, our grand Buſineſs is carri'd on with the more vigour. He that ſometimes remits of an ordinary Imployment, or lays it aſide, whereby he might make trivial Gain to himſelf; that ſo with more Applicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on he may purſue a better, that will turn to vaſt profit: inſtead of hindring his Buſineſs, does greatly further it. As the Apoſtle tells us, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.6. <hi>Godlineſs is</hi> great gain. As it is a real and rich Treaſure in it ſelf, ſo it draws a mighty Wealth after it, and intitles us to an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparable Eſtate; even to <hi>an Inheritance incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible, undefiled, and that fadeth not away, reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in Heaven for us,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.4. Now holy <hi>Mourning</hi> being a conſiderable Branch of God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, it muſt help to veſt us in this Title, and to convey this rare <hi>Inheritance</hi> to us. The Man therefore that ſometimes abates of his Worldly Cares, the more diligently to attend this higher Concern; can by no means be thought to <hi>hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> his Buſineſs, but wiſely to promote it.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Of</hi> more Particular Mourning. Reaſons <hi>why we muſt Mourn for</hi> our own Sins; The Goſpel requires it. The Nature of Sin calls for it; <hi>and ſo do</hi> the Sufferings of our SAVIOUR. We are taught it by Example. It helps to Repentance, and deſtroys Impieties. It ſtrengthens our Graces, and may haſten our Tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the Endleſs Glory.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>HAving treated thus largely of <hi>Mourning</hi> in <hi>General,</hi> it will now be proper to ſpeak to the particular Sorts of it, and to perſwade Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians to mourn for their <hi>own,</hi> and for <hi>other mens</hi> Impieties. And this I ſhall ſeriouſly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to do, by laying down <hi>Reaſons</hi> for <hi>both</hi> the Duties, and then by offering plain <hi>Suaſives</hi> to the ſame.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Reaſons</hi> why we muſt mourn for our own Sins, are theſe <hi>Five</hi> that follow.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> Becauſe <hi>the Goſpel requires it.</hi> The HOLY JESUS <hi>is King of Kings, and</hi> LORD <hi>of</hi> LORDS, <hi>Rev.</hi> 19.16. And as He governs the World by His Sovereign Power; ſo His Church He rules according to His bleſſed Will and Pleaſure. But then His Will is declared in His Law; and that Law is contained in the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> which by Himſelf and his Emiſſaries was promulgated from Heaven. So that whatever the Goſpel impoſeth on us, we are indiſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly obliged to perform. We may no more ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:34484:125"/> to reject any thing of that nature, than we ſhould dare to forfeit that infinite Bliſs, which the Goſpel offers; or to incurr that direful and intolerable Puniſhment, wherewith it threatens the Diſobedient. If therefore it appears, that the Goſpel <hi>injoyns</hi> us to mourn for our Sins, we are oblig'd to think it a <hi>Duty</hi> upon us, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly muſt <hi>practiſe</hi> it. And that this is one inalterable Statute or Injunction of the Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic Law; is ſufficiently evident. For we find it plainly enacted and recorded, S. <hi>Jam.</hi> 4.9. <hi>Be afflicted, and mourn, and weep.</hi> Not that the Apoſtle would have us raiſe up Troubles, or pull down Miſeries upon our ſelves; enough of which we are like to have, without our own procuring: but ſpeaking to Chriſtians in the capacity of <hi>Sinners,</hi> or under that notion (as the Context ſhows;) he charges them to lay their Miſcarriages to heart, and to bewail their reſpective <hi>Perſonal</hi> Iniquities.</p>
               <p>And here we muſt obſerve, that <hi>three Steps</hi> are to be taken by us, or three Advances to be made, if we would perfect this Duty. We muſt be <hi>afflicted,</hi> and we muſt <hi>mourn,</hi> and we muſt <hi>weep.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1ſt, We muſt be <hi>afflicted.</hi> The true meaning of which Word here, may beſt be pickt out of a Parallel Text, <hi>Joel</hi> 2.12, 13. <hi>There</hi> the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet directs Sinners to turn to the LORD, <hi>with Weeping, and Mourning, with Renting the Heart,</hi> and with <hi>Faſting. Here</hi> the Apoſtle ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges them, to draw nigh to GOD, with <hi>Mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> and <hi>Weeping;</hi> but inſtead of <hi>Renting the Heart</hi> and <hi>Faſting,</hi> adviſes them to be <hi>afflicted.</hi> And ſo in that <hi>one</hi> Term is couched the ſenſe of
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:34484:125"/> the other <hi>two.</hi> Whence we may gather, that if we would <hi>afflict</hi> our ſelves Evangelically, we muſt <hi>rent our Hearts</hi> in the firſt Place. That is, we muſt enter ſo deep into ſerious Thoughts of the vileneſs of Sin, and of our own baſeneſs in committing it againſt ſo good a GOD; and muſt ſo revolve theſe Thoughts, and that Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthineſs in our Minds, as that they may cauſe an <hi>Anguiſh</hi> in our Hearts. An Anguiſh ſo bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, as to be ready to fret our very Hearts to Pieces, as it were, or to tare them aſunder: which kind of Affliction is that which by Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines is called <hi>Contrition.</hi> But by the way, let none of theſe words which ſeem ſo harſh, and ſound ſo loud, fright us in the leaſt; as if when this Mourning ſinks ſo deep, or grows ſo ſtrong, it ſhould let in <hi>Melancholy,</hi> or ſhut <hi>Joy</hi> out. For the Bitterer theſe Pangs of Sorrow prove, the ſweeter Comforts do they commonly bring forth; and the ſooner likewiſe are they produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced. And then to compleat this holy Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to <hi>Renting our Hearts</hi> we muſt add <hi>Faſting.</hi> And very properly, conſidering how very <hi>af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictive</hi> it is. For, 1ſt, It is a piece of juſt <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge</hi> upon our ſelves for any degrees of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperance, which in any Inſtances we have ever been guilty of: at which door innumera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Follies and Tranſgreſſions enter upon the Children of Men. 2ly, It is a piece of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable <hi>Self-denial;</hi> as being a voluntary or choſen Abſtinence from thoſe ordinary Refecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which are really gratifying as well as nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing; and yield much delight as well as ſuſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance to Nature. 3ly, It is alſo a ſevere Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian <hi>virtue,</hi> as it is an Act of Submiſſion, or humble Obedience to our LORD JESUS
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:34484:126"/> CHRIST: Who in his eternal Goſpel hath ſignifi'd it to be our Duty. But then we muſt remember what <hi>kind</hi> of Faſt this is to be. Not a <hi>Civil</hi> Faſt which the Magiſtrate injoins for Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litical Ends; nor a <hi>Moral</hi> Faſt, which is a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant keeping to moderate Diet, that ſo the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy may neither be pamper'd by too much Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turity, nor pin'd and weakn'd with too much Abſteniouſneſs: but a <hi>Religious</hi> Faſt. And that is two-fold, <hi>Spiritual</hi> or <hi>Corporal.</hi> The <hi>Spiritual</hi> Faſt is a Faſt from <hi>Sin;</hi> which the Chriſtian ought to keep all his life long. The <hi>Corporal</hi> Faſt is an extraordinary <hi>Abſtinence,</hi> upon extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary Occaſion, from <hi>Meat,</hi> and <hi>Drink,</hi> (as well as bodily <hi>Pleaſures</hi>) ſo far as it ſtands with our Health, and our beſt Capacity of ſerving GOD. And this Faſt is <hi>double</hi> likewiſe. Ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Public</hi> in time of general Calamity; or <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate</hi> in caſe of Particular Concern, or of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal Judgments felt, or feared. The <hi>Private</hi> Faſt is that here intended. Nor can we ever uſe it more ſeaſonably than on the days of <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation</hi> for our Sins; as being very inſtrumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal towards obtaining Pardon. And then 2ly, we muſt <hi>mourn.</hi> Which naturally follows upon our being <hi>afflicted.</hi> For where our Thoughts are fixed ſeriouſly on our Sins, and ſo roll up and down, and recoil in our Minds, as to ſwell our Hearts with Heavineſs, and Anguiſh; they'll quickly raiſe a great Grief within. Such a Grief, as will cauſe us to do in reference to our Sins, as <hi>Hezekiah</hi> did upon account of His Sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; <hi>Mourn as Doves, Iſai.</hi> 38.14.</p>
               <p>Now theſe two, <hi>Affliction,</hi> and <hi>Mourning,</hi> are the loweſt Strains of godly ſorrow for Sin: ſuch as <hi>all</hi> at times muſt take up and expreſs. And
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:34484:126"/> if in ſome Sinners there never riſe ſuch Clouds of Sorrow, as diſſolve in Showrs of Tears; yet they muſt ſometimes be overcaſt with ſuch as will darken their Minds, and ſadden their Hearts, and thunder in their Conſciences, and ſtrike and afflict them with ſuch Terror, and Trouble, for their Sins, as will cauſe them to <hi>mourn</hi> with <hi>Sighs,</hi> and <hi>Groans,</hi> that are proper Accents of a pious Remorſe. And truly where Nature is ſo hard and dry, as upon <hi>no account</hi> to yield any Tears, 'twill be very<note n="*" place="margin">See Chap. 4th.</note> ſufficient for ſincere Penitents, to be afflicted and mourn <hi>thus.</hi> They may lawfully enough ſtop here, becauſe 'tis impoſſible they ſhould proceed far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. But for all that <hi>can</hi> do it, there remains another Step to be taken, they muſt advance to an higher degree of Sorrow, and to a fuller Expreſſion of it, that of <hi>Tears.</hi> For,</p>
               <p n="3">3ly, We muſt <hi>Weep.</hi> This is the beſt End that Sin can come to. And when once it comes to this, the poor Delinquent will run as faſt to GOD, as ever he ran from Him. And partly for this Reaſon: becauſe <hi>ſuch Sorrow</hi> as provokes to <hi>Tears,</hi> does <hi>imbitter</hi> Sin. That which kept him from GOD before, was only the <hi>Love</hi> which he had to <hi>Sin.</hi> And the love he had to it, ſprung up from the <hi>ſweetneſs</hi> and <hi>pleaſure</hi> he found in it. But when we are happily ſtruck with a deep ſenſe of Sin, or with ſuch Convicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Pangs of Conſcience, as make us weep ſavourly for it: then all its Sweetneſs which formerly bewitcht us, will turn to ſuch bitter <hi>trouble</hi> and <hi>torment,</hi> as will render it more diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtful, than ever it was delightful to us. So that now inſtead of following it any farther, we ſhall flee as faſt as we are able from it; and
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:34484:127"/> ſhall alſo flee as faſt to GOD, to reſcue us out of that fear and danger into which it hath brought us. For by this time we ſhall perceive that Sin hath faſtned ſuch a <hi>Sting</hi> in us, as none but <hi>He</hi> is able to draw out; and laid ſuch a load of Guilt and Death upon us, as He only is able to take off. And when the Greatneſs of our Miſery, and alſo its Incurableneſs by any other, hath throughly convinc'd us that all our help is in GOD alone; this will drive us directly to Him for Relief, which is not to be had from any beſides.</p>
               <p>And thus we have a <hi>Reaſon</hi> fairly ſuggeſted, why all that can do it are oblig'd by S. <hi>James,</hi> to <hi>weep</hi> for their Sins. Not for any pleaſure GOD takes in our Sorrow; for he does <hi>not afflict willingly, nor grieve the Children of Men, Lam.</hi> 3.33: but meerly to <hi>eſtrange,</hi> or <hi>wean</hi> us from Sin, by making it bitter and uneaſy to us; and to win and bring us home unto Himſelf. A Thought which ſhould work kindly with us methinks, and make us the more forward to weep for our Offences, as well as the more free or liberal in our Tears. And the rather ſhould we be thus, that ſo the <hi>Eye,</hi> which is a great Occaſion of Sin, might bear its part in propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionable Mourning. <hi>Remember,</hi> ſays the Son of <hi>Sirach, that a wicked Eye is an evil thing; and what is created more wicked than an Eye? there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it weepeth upon every occaſion, Ecclus.</hi> 31.13. And if the Eye be ſo evil, and ſo prone to weeping; nothing can be more juſt, than that it ſhould weep for Sin: that ſo that Guilt may run out at its Tears, which ran in at its Glan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</p>
               <pb n="241" facs="tcp:34484:127"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> We muſt mourn for our <hi>own</hi> Sins, becauſe <hi>the Nature of Sin calls for it, and alſo the Sufferings of our</hi> SAVIOUR. Sin, if we look to its Definition, which ſhows its Nature, is<note n="*" place="margin">
                     <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>.</note> 
                  <hi>illegality</hi> in the Abſtract, or a <hi>tranſgreſſion</hi> of the divine Law. So an inſpired Pen deſcribes it, 1 S. <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.4. Now if Sin be a tranſgreſſion of the Law, it muſt neceſſarily be an oppoſition to GOD's Will; the written Law being no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe but His revealed Mind. And what can be more vile than that Evil, the very Eſſence of which is a direct repugnancy to GOD, and ſo an abſolute Contrariety to the moſt pure, perfect, and eternal GOOD? Where rational Creatures, as we are, have choſen and delighted in a thing ſo extreamly, ſo infinitely baſe; ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly we cannot but think we have reaſon to <hi>mourn</hi> for ſo egregious Folly, and that it calls for Mourning to the higheſt <hi>Pitch.</hi> If we loſe an Eſtate, or loſe a Child; loſe a Friend, or loſe a Limb; we grieve exceſſively, and ſink deep in Sadneſs and Lamentation. But how then ſhould we overflow with Sorrow for Sin, as being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakably worſe, than the worſt of Evils! which be they never ſo many, and never ſo bad, are all but the iſſues or products of <hi>that.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And then the ſame Sin which is ſo <hi>evil</hi> in it ſelf, occaſion'd <hi>moſt dreadful Sufferings</hi> to our SAVIOUR. Should I go about to deſcribe them in their Heighth and Bitterneſs, Time would fail me, and Words too. And therefore our Hearts methinks ſhould ſend forth <hi>flouds</hi> of <hi>mournful</hi> Tears at our weeping Eyes, when we think they were indured for <hi>our Sins.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That there ſhould be <hi>ſuch a Mourning</hi> amongſt all good <hi>Chriſtians</hi> for their SAVIOUR's
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:34484:128"/> 
                  <hi>Paſſion;</hi> was foretold long ſince by a famous Prophet; <hi>Zech.</hi> 12.10, 11. <hi>And I will pour upon the houſe of</hi> David, <hi>and upon the inhabitants of</hi> Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem, <hi>the Spirit of grace, and of ſupplication, and they ſhall look upon me whom they have pierced, and they ſhall mourn for Him, as one that mourneth for His only Son, and ſhall be in bitterneſs for Him, as he that is in Bitterneſs for his firſt-born. In that day there ſhall be a</hi> great Mourning. The SPIRIT of Grace was to be poured out upon the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Church; and when, and wherever that bleſſed Effuſion ſhould be graciouſly made; by this Prediction; there muſt be liberal Mourning for JESUS's <hi>Sufferings</hi> cauſed by our Sins. As therefore we have<note n="*" place="margin">Quem continuè irritarunt, &amp; quaſi telis rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lionis ſuae pupuge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runt. <hi>Calv.</hi> in loc.</note> 
                  <hi>continually provoked our</hi> SAVIOUR, <hi>and pierced Him with the darts of our rebellious Practices;</hi> ſo let us mourn, and that greatly and bitterly for the ſame. And ſo we ſhall certainly do, unleſs our Hearts be drier than a <hi>Pumice;</hi> and harder than <hi>Adamant.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> We muſt Mourn for our <hi>own</hi> Sins, becauſe <hi>in Scripture we are exampled to it.</hi> We are very apt to be led by Example, and a ſtrong and mighty force it is, that we feel from the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence and power of it. And that it is of a potent Efficacy, is clear from hence; that Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven it ſelf often referrs us to Example, as deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to work upon us by it: <hi>Look unto</hi> Abraham <hi>your Father, and unto</hi> Sarah <hi>that bare you, Iſai.</hi> 51.2. Yea, this is one Reaſon why GOD ſent His SON in the likeneſs of our Fleſh; that He might be a Pattern or Preſident of Righteouſneſs to us, and His exemplary Obedience might en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage ours. (Tho' this was far from being the <hi>chief,</hi> and farther from being the <hi>ſole</hi> End of His Incarnation, as ſome contend.) And as
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:34484:128"/> beſides that of His SON, GOD, in the holy Book, has recommended ſeveral other great Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples, to excite our religious Imitation: ſo He ſtrictly requires us to live well <hi>our ſelves,</hi> that thereby we might become <hi>exemplary</hi> unto <hi>others. Let your light ſo ſhine before Men, that they may ſee your good Works, and glorify your Father which is in Heaven, Mat.</hi> 5.16. And there being ſuch no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Strength in Example, to draw us over to compliance <hi>with,</hi> or conformity <hi>to</hi> it ſelf; to bring Men to mourn piouſly for their Sins, 'twill be proper to remember <hi>thoſe</hi> that have done ſo. And here of many Examples in the ſacred Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lume, let me note but a few.</p>
               <p>For this, King <hi>David</hi> was eminently remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, as his own Words witneſs. <hi>I am weary of my groaning, all the night make I my bed to ſwim, Pſal.</hi> 6.6. So unintermitting was His Grief, that his Groans were inceſſant: and when in his Bed he ſhould have reſted in Sleep, he was ſwim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming in Tears. Nor was it thus with him for a few <hi>minutes</hi> at a time, <hi>once</hi> in a <hi>great while;</hi> but his violent Sorrows laſted <hi>long,</hi> and returned <hi>of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten.</hi> He ſpent himſelf in them, and was wearied with them<note n="*" place="margin">

                  </note> 
                  <hi>all the night,</hi> or <hi>every night,</hi> for ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral together. Inſomuch that he complained v. 7th, <hi>Mine Eye is conſumed becauſe of grief.</hi> A ſad Symptom of exceſſive Mourning, when his Eyes were waſted with continual Weeping; and his Sight was ſunk into ſenſible Decay, through the great plenty of Tears which he ſhed. Nor did this Sorrow flow from the pains of Sickneſs, or inſults of Enemies only; but from the <hi>guilt</hi> of his <hi>Sins</hi> chiefly. So the <hi>Quality</hi> of this <hi>Pſalm</hi> gives us to underſtand. For it is not only a <hi>peniten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial</hi> one, but the <hi>firſt</hi> of them that are called by
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:34484:129"/> that name. And when in it he deplored the <hi>other Miſeries,</hi> 'twas only ſo far as they were cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and deſerved by his <hi>hainous Sins.</hi> Nor did he mourn thus ſadly by <hi>Night</hi> only, but alſo by <hi>Day. I go mourning all the day long, Pſal.</hi> 38.6. And this was upon Account of his <hi>Sins</hi> again. <hi>Mine iniquities are gone over mine Head; as an hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy burthen, they are too heavy for me.</hi> 'Twas the weight of their <hi>guilt</hi> that ſo ſadly depreſſed him.

                  <hi>Tho' I ſhould dye with Thee, yet will I not deny Thee.</hi> He acted it within a very <hi>ſhort time,</hi> even a very few hours after the Warning given, and this Promiſe made. He acted it at no <hi>diſtance</hi> from our Lord neither, but in the ſame Houſe, and in the ſame Room where He was; within His View, and before His Face. And yet He was one of the <hi>firſt</hi> Apoſtles that CHRIST ever called, and amongſt all the Apoſtles one chiefly favoured. Nor did he barely deny his Maſter, but he did it <hi>three times,</hi> one after another, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terlarding his Denials with<note n="†" place="margin">ver. 74.</note>

               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> We muſt mourn for our <hi>own</hi> Sins, becauſe it <hi>helps forward Repentance,</hi> and <hi>destroys Impiety.</hi> It helps forward Repentance. <hi>By the ſadneſs of the countenance the Heart is made better,</hi> ſays <hi>Solomon, Eccleſ.</hi> 7.3. He ſpeaks there of ſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs ariſing from <hi>Civil</hi> Occaſions. And truly that's an excellent Preſervative of Innocence, and ſo makes us better than otherwiſe we ſhould have been, by keeping us from growing worſe. For it tames our Wildneſs, and binds up our Looſneſs; it fixes our Minds, and unites our Thoughts, and makes us ſerious and conſiderate. It calms the turbulency of our reſtleſs Paſſions, and takes off the Gayneſs of our wanton Fancies, and rebates the Edge, and eager fierceneſs of our raging Appetites, and vain Affections; and ſo indiſpoſes us to immoral Actions. When Satan tempts a ſorrowful Perſon, he ſtrikes fire, as it were, into wet Gunpowder, that will not readily kindle. Now if <hi>Worldly</hi> Sorrow (as we are taught to call that which does not flow from Religious Principles) be of ſuch force to <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent Sin;</hi> how very powerful muſt <hi>Godly</hi> Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row be to lead us to <hi>Repentance?</hi> For <hi>godly ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row worketh Repentance to Salvation, not to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented of,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.10. It cauſeth us to repent ſo truly, and throughly, as to bring us into a Moſt ſafe condition, and to Qualify us for Happineſs whenever we dy, tho' our ſins have been never ſo great and numerous. And they that repent at ſuch a Rate, muſt be far from repining at what they have done.</p>
               <p>And as this <hi>Sorrow according to</hi> GOD, <hi>helps forward Repentance;</hi> ſo it effectually <hi>destroys Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piety.</hi> Penitential Tears rot the Weeds of Sin at the Root: they never thrive, nor can they live

Which ſeem to inſinuate, that there is a <hi>decreed Pitch</hi> or <hi>Perfection</hi> for us to reach in this Life before we can dy, and aſcend to Bleſſedneſs. And ſhall we not haſte on then, by holy <hi>Mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> with all poſſible ſpeed, to the heighth of Grace, which muſt be accompliſht in us? What would we not fain be in Heaven? Do we not ſigh and groan under the Load of our Mortality; and would we not gladly be freed from the heavy Burthen, and hard Bondage of it? Are we not weary of our preſent Troubles, and do we not complain of many uneaſineſſes; and ſhould not a call to endleſs Reſt, and perfect Joy be welcome to us? Or had we rather con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue here, and abide ſtill in this earthly State? O ſenſeleſs, ſtupid, and egregious Folly! can we love our Priſons, and embrace our Chains,
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:34484:131"/> and hug our Fetters? Can we court a longer Exile from our eternal Home, and be content to be kept out of the coeleſtial Kingdom? Is not God our loving Father there? Is not CHRIST our tender Husband there? Is not the HOLY GHOST our ſweeteſt Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forter there? And to go lower; are not many of our good Friends and dear Relatives there? And is not the greateſt part of the true Church gone thither, and now triumphing in the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of our LORD? and can we once wiſh to ſtay behind? Does not the Hireling long for his Pay? The Servant, for his Wages? The Souldier, for his Reward? The Husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, for his Harveſt? The Heir, for his Inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance? And do not we long, and pant, and ardently deſire to be in Heaven? It will be ſeen here whether we do or no; for then we ſhall <hi>mourn</hi> the oftener, and the more earneſtly, that ſo we may get thither quickly. To all good Chriſtians, the Gates of Heaven are ſet wide open, and the faſter we improve in Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Grace, the ſooner poſſibly we ſhall enter. What more forcible <hi>Reaſon</hi> can there be, or <hi>Motive</hi> either to provoke to <hi>this Duty?</hi> If we can outſtand the Dint of <hi>this,</hi> vain it will be to propound any more, well therefore may it be the <hi>Laſt</hi> I offer.</p>
               <p>Let good Chriſtians think ſeriouſly with themſelves, what a vaſt difference there is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween what we <hi>are</hi> now, and what we <hi>hope</hi> to be hereafter. What a ſad caſe are we in here? What variety of <hi>Infirmities</hi> encompaſs and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commode us? We have ſtupid Minds, and crooked Wills; clouded Underſtandings, and erroneous Judgments; unfaithful Memories,
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:34484:132"/> and extravagant Affections; ſenſual Deſires, and unruly Appetites; polluted Souls, and fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy, ſickly, mortal Bodies. What a bleſſed Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition ſhall we be in above? and what a fulneſs of Beatitude ſhall there ſurround us? For be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides a freedom from the aforeſaid Complaints, we ſhall have a clear and moſt comfortable Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of GOD, whom our Souls upon Earth ſo entirely loved. The immediate Fruition of the eternal JESUS, whoſe very Name was ſo raviſhing to us. The taking Society of Angels moſt ſpotleſs and illuſtrious, that now do us good, and we perceive it not. The delightful Fellowſhip of departed Saints, whom we prized ſo much, and were ſo loth to forego. Souls pure as the brighteſt Cherubim, and Bodies at length more glittering and radiant, than the Starrs or Sun. And ſhall not the hope of ſuch high Preferment, make us forward to increaſe in Grace, tho' it were by <hi>Mourning,</hi> that ſo we may the <hi>ſooner</hi> be inveſted with it? Does not the ſenſe of our many <hi>Miſeries,</hi> make us impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently deſirous of Heaven? Are not our Sins many? Are not our Doubts, and Fears, and Diſtractions many? Do not theſe rend our Hearts, and afflict our Spirits, and ſting, and gnaw, and wound our Conſciences? and make us oftentimes reſtleſs and joyleſs? Can we ſerve and pleaſe GOD, as the Souls of the juſt made perfect do? Can we ſee Him, and know Him, and love Him, and laud Him, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive Happineſs from Him, as they do? Alas, the beſt Services which we perform to Him, and the Higheſt Felicities we receive from Him, in theſe lower Regions; are not worthy to be named in the ſame day with theirs. The <hi>Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties</hi>
                  <pb n="251" facs="tcp:34484:132"/> we offer up to GOD are lame and imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, mingled with Failings, and many Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes; and ſcarce deſerve the Name of Duties. And anſwerable to our Duties to Him, are our <hi>Comforts</hi> from Him; ſo faint, and low, in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon, that they ſcarce deſerve the Name of Comforts. If now and then we can get a ſlight Taſte of GOD's Goodneſs, a ſhort Glimpſe of His Countenance, a ſingle Beam of His Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour darted into our Souls; that's all which ordinary Chriſtians commonly attain to. But O the quick and lively ſenſe, that the Saints in Glory have of GOD's Love! O the cloſe and ſweet Embraces that they there feel in the Arms of His Mercy! O the freſh Torrents of inceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant Joys, that always overflow, and exceedingly affect them! They continually bathe themſelves in ſtreams of delight, that iſſue directly from the Great JEHOVAH: and ſwim in ſuch an Ocean of Divineſt Pleaſures, as hath indeed nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Bounds nor Bottom. Nor is the <hi>meaſure</hi> of their Happineſs, beyond its <hi>Duration,</hi> for in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of that, it is really infinite, being to laſt as long as GOD Himſelf.</p>
               <p>Now are not theſe Excellent things worth the having? Can there be any more valuable, and ſo more eligible than they? And conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently can we deſire any thing ſo much, as a <hi>ſpeedy Paſſage</hi> into the Fruition of them? Would we not gladly exchange corruption, for Glory; and a dying Life, for bleſſed Immortality? Had we not rather ſit down before the Throne of GOD, in Holineſs and Triumph; than abide here in a condition of Sin, in a ſtate of Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and in a vale of Tears? In ſhort, were it not better for us to be taken up into the Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:34484:133"/> on high, to reap the Fruits and injoy the Rewards of our reſpective Labours; than ſtill to be imploy'd in any painful Exerciſes. Why, if in reality we think it better, and accordingly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire it; let us manifeſt the ſincerity of our De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires, by the Earneſtneſs of our Endeavours to encreaſe our Graces by <hi>holy Mourning.</hi> Happy are they who by any Piece of early Piety, do ſo advance or augment their Graces; as to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain an <hi>early</hi> aſcent to Heaven.</p>
               <p>And to encourage a little farther yet; as we ſhall go to Heaven perhaps the <hi>ſooner</hi> for this, ſo we ſhall have the more <hi>Glory</hi> there. Every Veſſel ſhall be full in that Sea; but yet the big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt ſhall receive moſt. That therefore we may be capable of the <hi>more Bliſs</hi> in Heaven, while we are on Earth let us <hi>enlarge</hi> our <hi>Graces</hi> by Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious <hi>Mourning.</hi>

               <argument>
                  <p>Reaſons <hi>why we muſt mourn</hi> for the Sins of others; <hi>The</hi> Beſt <hi>have done it. The</hi> neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect <hi>of it is</hi> blameable. It prevails with Heaven. It brings us Comforts. It ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cures us from Judgments, when others fall by them. Both Nature and Religion bind us to it. <hi>It may be</hi> we have been Sharers <hi>in the</hi> Sins of others.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>HAving given in the <hi>Reaſons</hi> why we muſt mourn for our <hi>own</hi> Sins; we are next to conſider what Reaſons there are for our Mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for the Sins of <hi>others.</hi> The <hi>Principal</hi> are theſe <hi>Seven</hi> enſuing.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> We muſt mourn for the ſins of <hi>others,</hi> becauſe the <hi>Beſt have done it.</hi> And ſo it is as much our Duty, as it is to anſwer the divine Intention, or the end of Providence in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording their Practice. For why hath the HOLY GHOST regiſtred good men, as <hi>great Mourners</hi> in this reſpect, but that we might come up to their excellent Patterns, and make our ſelves happy by conformity to them?</p>
               <p>And that this may be done, we ſhould be often viewing and ſeriouſly contemplating ſuch worthy <hi>Exemplars</hi> of this Nature, as in the ſacred <hi>Writings</hi> are ſet before us. For ſo by obſerving and wiſely conſidering them, we may in time become <hi>like</hi> them. And to work our ſelves to ſo bleſſed an Aſſimilation, let us turn our Eyes,
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:34484:134"/> and fix our Thoughts upon <hi>ſome</hi> of thoſe fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Perſons in Scripture, who bear the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of Mourners for <hi>other Mens</hi> Sins.</p>
               <p>The <hi>firſt</hi> of them we note, is <hi>Ezra;</hi> of whom in that Book which bears his Name, we read thus.<note n="*" place="margin">Ezra 10.6.</note> 
                  <hi>Then</hi> Ezra <hi>roſe up from before the Houſe of</hi> GOD, <hi>and went into the chamber of</hi> Johanan <hi>the Son of</hi> Eliashib: <hi>and when he came thither, he did eat no Bread nor drink Water; for he mourned becauſe of the trangreſſion of them that had been carri'd away captive.</hi> A plain caſe that the good man laid the Sins of his People to heart, and that ſo far as to mourn for them. And that he mourned <hi>deeply,</hi> as well as <hi>truly,</hi> appears from his carriage: for in the day of his Mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, he neither <hi>ate</hi> nor <hi>drank;</hi> no, not ſo much as a Bit of Bread, or a Drop of Water. Nor did his Mourning cauſe <hi>Abſtinence</hi> only, but alſo <hi>Amazement;</hi> another Argument of its Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. For as we find in the foregoing chapter, he<note n="†" place="margin">ver. 4.</note> 
                  <hi>ſat aſtonied until the Evening Sacrifice.</hi> Such was the ſadneſs and heavineſs he conceiv'd for the People's Guilt, and ſo very much loaden and oppreſſed was he with its ponderous Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then; that for the greateſt part of a whole Day together, he was ſcarce able to riſe up from un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it. Too few, I fear, are now a days ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of ſuch a Preſſure.</p>
               <p>Next to <hi>Ezra,</hi> in the ſacred Book, ſtands <hi>Nehemiah.</hi> Who does not only <hi>equal</hi> Him in the Performance we are upon, but ſeems to <hi>out-do</hi> him. His own Words teſtify no leſs, <hi>Nehem.</hi> 1.4. <hi>And it came to paſs when I heard theſe words, that I ſat down and wept; and mourned certain Days, and faſted, and prayed before the</hi> GOD <hi>of Heaven.</hi> That he was here concern'd
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:34484:134"/> not only for the <hi>Affliction,</hi> and <hi>Reproach</hi> of his People mentioned <hi>v.</hi> 3; but moſtly for their ſins, the cauſe of thoſe Evils; is evident from what occurs in the 6th verſe. For there we find, that he <hi>prayed before</hi> GOD <hi>day and night, for the children of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>and confeſſed</hi> the ſins, <hi>which they had ſinned againſt Him.</hi> So that when he ſat down (on the Ground, that is, or in Aſhes, as the way of Mourners was amongſt the <hi>Jews</hi>) and wept; his Tears were ſpent chiefly upon their <hi>Sins.</hi> And for their ſins it was, that he faſted and prayed and that he <hi>mourned</hi> certain <hi>Days.</hi> As ſays<note n="*" place="margin">Multis diebus.</note> the <hi>vulgar</hi> Tranſlation, <hi>many days;</hi> and ſo <hi>Lyra</hi> reads it. And how <hi>many</hi> theſe days were that Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tator expreſsly declares, when he ſays, that he mourned<note n="†" place="margin">Tribus menſibus.</note> 
                  <hi>three months.</hi> Nor is his Aſſertion at all improbable. For he began his Mourning in <hi>Chiſleu (Neh.</hi> 1.1.) which is the <hi>ninth</hi> month with the <hi>Hebrews:</hi> and in <hi>Niſan</hi> the <hi>firſt</hi> of their months, he was ſo deep in it, that as we learn in the beginning of the 2d chapter, the King diſcerned <hi>the Sorrow of his Heart,</hi> by the <hi>ſadneſs of his Countenance.</hi> And from <hi>Chiſleu,</hi> to <hi>Niſan,</hi> it muſt be three Months at leaſt. How many amongſt us, tho' they live to great years, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow not half that time in the whole courſe of their Lives, on this needful Duty?</p>
               <p>After theſe <hi>two</hi> ſuch famous men, a <hi>greater</hi> follows; the King of <hi>Iſrael.</hi> And as he was above them in dignity and power; ſo in holy <hi>Mourning</hi> for the ſins of <hi>others,</hi> he was not at all inferiour to them. Witneſs that remarkable Declaration of his, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.136. <hi>Mine eyes guſh out with waters,</hi> (or as the <hi>other</hi> Tranſlation renders it more<note n="‖" place="margin">

<pb n="256" facs="tcp:34484:135"/> down mine Eyes, becauſe they keep not thy Law.</hi> It was too much in <hi>David</hi>'s Time, as now it is in <hi>our Days:</hi> the World was full of naughty men, that made no conſcience of Duty to GOD. Inſtead of keeping His Laws, they grievouſly violated them; the obſervation of which would have made them righteous here, and moſt bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed for ever. But how did <hi>David</hi> reſent this? Like a pious Prince, and the Prophet of GOD, he <hi>mourned</hi> for it at a mighty Rate. Inſomuch that his ſwelling and exceſſive Grief diſcharged it ſelf in <hi>abundance</hi> of pious <hi>Tears.</hi> Not like a violent Land-floud, the which is ſuddenly up, and as ſoon down: but like ſettled <hi>Rivers,</hi> which keep on in a free and even courſe, and flow with conſtant and copious ſtreams. How hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily would it be for the Chriſtian Church, were ſtore of its Members of ſuch a melting Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per!</p>
               <p>To the <hi>Three</hi> foregoing, I muſt add a <hi>Fourth,</hi> which is <hi>Jeremiah.</hi> And ſo eminent a Mourner was he in the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Church, that he compoſed a Book of <hi>Lamentions</hi> for Her. That he was the <hi>Author,</hi> or Pen-man of it, the <hi>ſeventy</hi> were ſo confident, that in a ſhort <hi>Proem</hi> they have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fixed to it, they warrant and proclaim as much in theſe words.<note n="*" place="margin">

And ſo affecting is the ſtile or ſtrain of it, and ſo piercing and pathetic the Expreſſions in it;<note n="†" place="margin">Orat. 12.</note> that <hi>Gregory Nazianzem</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſes of himſelf, that <hi>as often as he read it, his Speech was ſtopt, and he overwhelm'd with Tears,</hi> And if peruſal of the Book wrought ſo power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully

               <p>But beſides thoſe in the <hi>Old,</hi> we have famous <hi>Mourners</hi> for <hi>other Mens</hi> Sins, in the <hi>New</hi> Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. I note but <hi>Three.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Firſt</hi> ſhall be S. <hi>Paul.</hi> Who was very <hi>fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent,</hi> as well as ſerious in the ſolemn Exerciſe. Nor was He only <hi>frequent,</hi> but <hi>conſtant</hi> in it. For as he profeſſes, <hi>Act.</hi> 20.19. <hi>he ſerved the</hi> LORD <hi>with all humility of Mind, and with many Tears, and Temptations.</hi> So that pious Mourning, and plenty of it, ſeems to have been as much his ſettled Companion, as <hi>Temptations</hi> were, from which a faithful Miniſter of CHRIST is ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom free. Nor did it hold for ſome Days, or Weeks only, but for <hi>Years</hi> together. It had dwelt with him now for <hi>three</hi> Years paſt, as he ſignifies at the 31th Verſe. <hi>By the ſpace of</hi> three Years, <hi>I ceaſed not to warn every one, night and day,</hi> with Tears. Was there ever ſuch a watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, was there ever ſuch a <hi>mournful</hi> Monitor as this? But then when he wept with ſuch Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy in a monitorial Capacity, many of his Tears muſt needs be ſpent upon <hi>other</hi> Mens ſins.</p>
               <p>And what is there <hi>implied,</hi> is other-where ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry plainly expreſt. As in <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.33; where he complains that he <hi>had great heavineſs, and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual ſorrow in his heart, for his brethren his Kinſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:34484:136"/> after the fleſh.</hi> For their hainous <hi>Sin,</hi> that is, in deſpiſing the Doctrine, and rejecting the rich Privileges of the Goſpel. And <hi>great hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vineſs,</hi> and <hi>continual ſorrow</hi> in the <hi>heart</hi> of a Man, proclaims him an unfeigned, and deep Mourner, for thoſe that cauſe or occaſion the ſame. So he tells the <hi>Philippians,</hi> and that with <hi>weeping,</hi> that <hi>they were Enemies of the Croſs of</hi> CHRIST, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.18. And what he <hi>did</hi> for <hi>them,</hi> he was ready to do for <hi>thoſe</hi> of another Church. I mean, to <hi>bewail</hi> the Corruptions and Calamities of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny that <hi>had ſinned and not repented,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.21. And whoever <hi>bewails</hi> ſuch as have <hi>not repented,</hi> plainly <hi>mourns</hi> for them, becauſe they have <hi>ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Out of the <hi>New Teſtament,</hi> I offer only <hi>one</hi> Inſtance more. But 'tis ſuch as infinitely out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>does all other, as being the moſt Holy and ever Bleſſed JESUS.

               </p>
               <p>Now if we look back upon the Perſons men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd, we cannot but ſee that they were Men of the beſt <hi>Ranks,</hi> as well as of the beſt <hi>Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples.

And which ſtill makes more for its Vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, and farther inforces the pious Exerciſe; our adorable LORD and SAVIOUR performed it as we have ſeen.

                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> We muſt mourn for the <hi>ſins of others</hi> becauſe <hi>to neglect it is highly blameable.</hi> It is GOD's Command to Chriſtians, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.15.

<pb n="263" facs="tcp:34484:138"/> malicious Accuſer of our Souls, may be able to charge upon us as ſuch. But then in order to this, 'twill be neceſſary for us to <hi>mourn</hi> for the known and ſcandalous Sins of thoſe about us; elſe the very <hi>omiſſion</hi> of that will render us groſsly <hi>culpable.</hi> So it did a whole Church once, and laid it under Apoſtolical Cenſure. The Church, I mean, was that at <hi>Corinth.</hi> It was newly planted, and had lately received the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Faith; and being juſt born, and in her tender Infancy, one would have thought, ſhe might have been innocent; Eſpecially having one ſo skilful and careful, ſo pious and prudent as St. <hi>Paul</hi> was, to ſuper-intend her; 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.1.

                     </gap>.</note> he had obtained the Degree of a <hi>Doctor.</hi> Now ſo grievous a Lewdneſs being ſo publickly committed amongſt the <hi>Corinthians;</hi> how ſhould they have behav'd themſelves in reference to the bold and ſhameful miſcarriage? They ought by all means to have <hi>lamented</hi> it, or <hi>mourned</hi> for it. And becauſe they did not, they are <hi>repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended</hi> and <hi>blamed</hi> by the great Apoſtle, in theſe Words: <hi>ye are puffed up and have not rather</hi> Mourned. Which gives us to underſtand, that when any in the Communion which we are of, fall into deadly and damnable Sins; it lies up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us to <hi>mourn</hi> for the ſame. And in caſe we do not, we are utterly in a fault. In a fault ſo
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:34484:139"/> great, that it deſerves expreſs <hi>Reproof</hi> from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. And as it highly deſerves it, it ſhall cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly have it; for indeed ſuch a fault, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it happens, ſtands <hi>actually reproved</hi> by GOD <hi>already,</hi> in thoſe very words which we laſt cited.</p>
               <p>As therefore we would eſcape the Dint of this Reproof, we muſt bewail the great Sins of all thoſe Chriſtians that come to our know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, but eſpecially of thoſe who belong to the <hi>ſame Church</hi> or <hi>Nation</hi> with us. And if they be ſo <hi>many</hi> (as GOD knows they are very numerous) that we cannot conſider and bewail them <hi>apart,</hi> or every one in particular; it muſt ſuffice that we do it in <hi>groſs,</hi> by a more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſive and general Mourning.</p>
               <p>But then we muſt take care that this our Mourning be not <hi>ſlight</hi> and <hi>ſuperficial,</hi> but deep and hearty; ſuch at leaſt for the ſadneſs and ſeriouſneſs of it, as we uſually beſtow on our <hi>departed</hi> Friends. And let none deſpiſe this <hi>Rule</hi> or Meaſure, as being borrowed from no meaner Perſon than learned <hi>Origen.</hi> For where he deſcribes the Diſcipline of the Primitive Church, he thus informs us.

               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> We muſt mourn for the <hi>Sins of others,</hi> becauſe ſuch Mourning <hi>prevails with Heaven.</hi> As we read, <hi>Lam.</hi> 3.26. <hi>The</hi> LORD <hi>is good to the Soul that ſeeketh Him.</hi> But how good He is to ſuch, and how ſtrangely he manifeſts His Goodneſs to them, in a gracious Readineſs to be found of them; none can tell like the well experienc'd. Yet, this I muſt ſay, that none prevail <hi>more,</hi> and none prevail <hi>ſooner</hi> with GOD, than they who ſeek Him with holy <hi>Mourning.</hi> And therefore when <hi>Jacob</hi> had <hi>Power</hi> with GOD, and ſuch Power, as to have his Name changed into <hi>Iſrael,</hi> in token of his ſignal Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valence with the ALMIGHTY; this Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful Remarkable Prevalence of His, was ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in good meaſure to pious <hi>Mourning.</hi> Nor can we be out in this our Aſſertion, foraſmuch as it plainly ſtands thus imputed, by a venera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble <hi>Prophet. By his ſtrength he had power with</hi> GOD: <hi>yea, he had power over the Angel, and prevailed, Hoſ.</hi> 12.3, 4. And <hi>why</hi> did he ſo? It follows, <hi>he</hi> wept <hi>and made ſupplication to Him.</hi> So that His mighty Prevalence and Succeſs, in great part, was due unto his <hi>Tears.</hi> But then to come home to our purpoſe, I muſt add; that as religious <hi>Tears,</hi> when ſhed for <hi>our ſelves,</hi> prevail with Heaven; ſo they will prevail for <hi>others</hi> likewiſe, when poured out to GOD up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their account. The following Inſtance will make this good beyond exception. <hi>Iſrael</hi> had
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:34484:140"/> provoked the LORD to Anger, and <hi>Moſes</hi> was afraid (as well he might) that He would <hi>deſtroy</hi> them. Hereupon <hi>he fell down before the</hi> LORD, <hi>Deut.</hi> 9.18. That is, he <hi>mourned,</hi> as well as prayed for the People: for <hi>Proſtration</hi> was a Poſture in uſe for both. And becauſe he mourned and wept, <hi>Rabbi Solomon</hi> called that forty days wherein then he fell down, (ſays mine<note n="*" place="margin">Quadra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gena tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabilis. <hi>Lyr.</hi> in loc.</note> Author) the <hi>forty Mournful days.</hi> And what the <hi>Effect</hi> of his Mournful interceſſion was, appears, <hi>v.</hi> 19. where we find that the LORD <hi>hearkened unto him at that time.</hi> And when the Mournful Importunity of <hi>one</hi> good Man, could quench the Fury of an inraged GOD, and ſave a wicked People from utter <hi>deſtruction;</hi> muſt it not carry a wonderful <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valence</hi> with it? For when he was minded to ruine the Rebellious <hi>Hebrews,</hi> and to blot out the <hi>Name,</hi> or <hi>Memory</hi> of them from under Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, as well as the <hi>Generation</hi> then living: He was pleas'd to cry out to <hi>Moſes,</hi>

                  <hi>Let me alone,</hi> or <hi>be gone from me.</hi> Implying there was ſuch force or power of reſtraint, in <hi>Moſes</hi>'s humble <hi>mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful</hi> Intreaty; that unleſs it was ſilenc'd or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved, GOD could not inflict thoſe juſt Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verities which <hi>he</hi> intended, and they deſerved. But then who that are truly and throughly good, can think they have not great Reaſon to mourn for the Sins of others, when thereby they may avert the Judgments of GOD which are due unto them? Yea, tho' thoſe Sins be moſt hainous of all, even <hi>National</hi> Sins; and the Judgments like to be proportionably heavy.</p>
               <pb n="267" facs="tcp:34484:140"/>
               <p>But here we muſt remember; that tho' the holy Mournings of all good people are very powerful and prevailing with Heaven: yet the Mournings of <hi>one ſort</hi> of Men always were, and ever will be of <hi>greateſt</hi> prevalence; namely, thoſe in the <hi>miniſterial</hi> Office. And therefore when terrible Judgments were coming upon the <hi>Jews,</hi> the Prophet expreſly charged the Prieſts, the Miniſters of the LORD, not only to <hi>pray,</hi> but alſo to <hi>weep</hi> in prevention of them, <hi>Joel</hi> 2.17. And then adds immediately (as the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py conſequence or effect of the ſame) <hi>Then will the</hi> LORD <hi>be jealous for His land and pity his People.</hi> So when Chriſtians at any time are viſited with Sickneſs, they are required to call for the <hi>Elders of the Church, to pray over them, Jam.</hi> 5.14. And ſo prevalent ſhall their Prayers be, (eſpecially when mingled with holy <hi>Tears</hi>) that if it be beſt, the LORD ſhall <hi>raiſe them up again,</hi> by reſtoring them to health; as the Apoſtle declares in the next Verſe. Nor need we wonder that the <hi>Clergies</hi> Prayers ſhould be moſt prevailing to prevent, or remove any manner of National or Perſonal Judgments. For if we rightly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, as they <hi>are</hi> (or <hi>ſhould be</hi>) Men of the <hi>moſt zeal,</hi> ſo they pray with the greateſt <hi>Authority;</hi> as being appointed and commiſſion'd thereunto, by virtue of the <hi>Function</hi> to which they are or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained. And (by the way) they being thus doubly qualifi'd to pray with <hi>moſt prevalence;</hi> they ſhould (as they have reaſon) do it with all <hi>Diligence.</hi> Pray even night and day to GOD for <hi>all</hi> his People, tho' for <hi>ſome</hi> perhaps much more than others; as particular Reſpects and Obligations bind them. Only when <hi>they</hi> or any <hi>other</hi> ſet apart a day, wherein to pray for their
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:34484:141"/> Souls, or to pray for their Bodies; for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of ſuch Sins as they have committed, or for the Removal of ſuch Severities, as GOD hath inflicted, or for the <hi>Suſpenſion</hi> of ſuch Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments as He hath plainly threatned: let them endeavour to inforce their Prayers with <hi>mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Tears,</hi> which adds to the Strength and Effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> We muſt mourn for the <hi>Sins of others,</hi> becauſe ſuch Mourning eſpecially <hi>brings us Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort.</hi> And this it may do <hi>two</hi> Ways. Either as it benefits thoſe <hi>Perſons</hi> whom we bewail; which when it comes to our knowledge, muſt needs afford us moſt noble ſatisfaction: or elſe as it inclines the gracious GOD, to diſpenſe His holy <hi>Conſolations</hi> to <hi>us,</hi> as a liberal recompence for our Chriſtian Pity, in laying our Brethrens Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carriages to Heart. As many as mourn for other mens Sins, muſt certainly be comforted <hi>one</hi> of theſe ways, if not <hi>both.</hi> Elſe the divine Promiſe muſt fail, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 57.18; <hi>I will reſtore Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts to him,</hi> and to his <hi>Mourners.</hi> Not only to <hi>reclaimed</hi> Sinners themſelves, that have well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered their crooked ways, and wiſely corrected and amended them: but alſo to thoſe <hi>Mourners</hi> for them, that have <hi>lamented</hi> their Immoralities, and great Offences. And have we not reaſon to mourn for <hi>others Sins,</hi> when thereby we ſhall draw down the Joys of Heaven upon <hi>our ſelves?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fifthly,</hi> We muſt mourn for the <hi>Sins of others,</hi> becauſe ſuch Mourning <hi>ſecures us from Judgments when others fall by them.</hi> Public and National Sins call for great and general Calamities; and it is but Juſt with GOD to ſend them. And when they come by His appointment, they are exactly what the Prophet of old termed them,
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:34484:141"/> 
                  <hi>Iſai.</hi> 28.15; an <hi>over-flowing ſcourge.</hi> A ſcourge that breaks in with moſt terrible Violence, and paſſes through a Country with ſuch ſpreading Fierceneſs, and irreſiſtible Fury, as is able to drown, and diſmally to ſweep away all before it. Now ſhould GOD, provoked to it by our Sins; in His great Diſpleaſure, ſend down any ſad Epidemical Evil upon this Nation; as the Sword, Famine, Peſtilence or the Like; and ſhould it dreadfully <hi>overflow</hi> the Land, from one end of it to the other, cutting off <hi>many</hi> if not <hi>moſt;</hi> and threatning, and indangering <hi>all:</hi> would it not then be a ſignal Favour, and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular Privilege or Felicity, for ſome <hi>few</hi> to be providentially diſtinguiſht from the reſt, and by a ſpecial Protection ſecured from the Dint of this judicial ſeverity? Yet thus it is ſometimes, yea, thus we may <hi>hope</hi> it always ſhall be, where there are <hi>Mourners</hi> for the Peoples ſins; and that <hi>thoſe</hi> very Mourners ſhall be the Perſons ſo Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved.</p>
               <p>For this <hi>hope</hi> there ſeems to be ſomewhat of good ground, in the ninth Chapter of <hi>Ezekiel.</hi> The Inhabitants of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> had committed many and moſt horrid Abominations; and thereby had mightily offended GOD, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſed His MAJESTY. To ſuch a Pitch, that he was now reſolv'd to deal with them in fury; neither to pity them, nor ſpare them, nor once to hear them, tho' they cried never ſo loud in His Ears. In purſuance of this His ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible Reſolution, He appointed <hi>ſix men with ſlaughter-weapons in their hands</hi> to deſtroy theſe Sinners; charging them in the Prophet's hearing, <hi>to ſlay utterly old and young, both Maids, and little Children, and Women,</hi> ver. 6. But amongſt theſe
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:34484:142"/> there were ſome holy <hi>Mourners</hi> for the People's ſins:<note n="*" place="margin">Ver. 4.</note> 
                  <hi>Men that ſighed,</hi> and <hi>cried</hi> for all the abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations that were done in the midſt of them. And what was to become of <hi>them?</hi> how were <hi>they</hi> to ſpeed? As the Viſion ſhows, GOD was exceeding kind to them, and by His gracious Providence extraordinary care was taken of them. For among the ſix men aforeſaid, there was one that had a Writers Ink-horn by his ſide. And him the LORD injoined to go through <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem,</hi> and to ſet a<note n="†" place="margin">Ib.</note> 
                  <hi>mark upon the foreheads of theſe Mourners,</hi> that ſo none of thoſe Deſtroyers might come near any of them. So far were they from being permitted to <hi>ſtrike</hi> them, that they might not dare ſo much as to come <hi>nigh</hi> them. And be this Viſion <hi>hiſtorical,</hi> as relating to things paſt; or <hi>prophetical,</hi> as reſpecting things to come; or perhaps <hi>both,</hi> as capable of being either; we may hope it contains nothing in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to the <hi>Jewiſh,</hi> but what may be made good as to the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Church. So that if any of us be ſo pious and tender hearted, as to ſigh and mourn for the ſad miſdemeanours of that ſinful people amongſt which we live; then when GOD ſends forth deſtroying Angels to execute His Judgments on the grievous Offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders; they may (as ſome have been) be <hi>markt</hi> out for an happy <hi>deliverance,</hi> and ſecured by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emption from the common Deſtiny. And if here be not ſufficient reaſon why we ſhould mourn for the ſins of that <hi>Place,</hi> or <hi>Nation</hi> we belong to; all that are wiſe and good may judge. For Deliverances granted under the <hi>Old</hi> Teſtament, upon the ſame ſort of Duties which continue under the <hi>New;</hi> in reaſon ſhould be granted to the performers of thoſe Duties under
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:34484:142"/> the <hi>New.</hi> For what's the foundation or cauſe of thoſe Deliverances, but GOD's Mercy? And His Mercy being more liberally diſpens'd under the <hi>New</hi> Teſtament, than the <hi>Old;</hi> why ſhould not <hi>Chriſtians</hi> rightly fulfilling the common Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, ſhare in the ſame kind of Deliverances that the <hi>Jews</hi> did for doing thoſe Duties?</p>
               <p>When <hi>Sodom</hi> was ſo dreadfully overthrown, and all its ungodly Inhabitants periſhed; how miraculouſly was <hi>Lot</hi> delivered? And <hi>why?</hi> Not only becauſe he was <hi>righteous; juſt Lot</hi> (as St. <hi>Peter</hi> terms him:) but becauſe he was <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>
                  <hi>Sixthly,</hi> We muſt mourn for the <hi>ſins of others,</hi> becauſe <hi>Nature and Religion bind us to it.</hi> We are <hi>Men,</hi> and all Men are made of <hi>one blood, Act.</hi> 17.26; and that <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, <hi>ſameneſs of blood,</hi> ſhould beget in us a Sympathy of Affections, even to the whole Maſs of living Mankind. And where we have true kindneſs for any, it will certainly expreſs it ſelf in compaſſion to them, and our Pity will ever be proportiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to their Miſery. The conſequence of which will be, that we muſt naturally bewail <hi>Sinners</hi> moſt, if we have but Grace to diſcern their Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery is greateſt.</p>
               <p>And then <hi>Religion,</hi> as well as <hi>Nature,</hi> obliges us to mourn for <hi>other mens ſins.</hi> For either they <hi>mourn</hi> for their own ſins, or they <hi>do not.</hi> If they <hi>do,</hi> we muſt comply with them, Divine Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand having made it our Duty to <hi>weep with them that weep, Rom.</hi> 12.15. By which Precept we are Particularly ti'd to mourn with thoſe
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:34484:143"/> that <hi>mourn for their ſins;</hi> inaſmuch as by <hi>them</hi> that <hi>weep</hi> there, are meant ſuch as are under<note n="*" place="margin">Vid. <hi>Grot.</hi> in loc. And Dr. <hi>Hammonds</hi> Annot.</note> 
                  <hi>Cenſure</hi> for their ſins; and ſo in Sorrow for them. If they <hi>do not mourn</hi> for their own ſins, we have the more Reaſon to do it for that. To ſee that they who have ſo great cauſe to mourn upon their own account, have yet no will (GOD help them) to ſet about it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Laſtly,</hi> We muſt mourn <hi>for the ſins of others,</hi> becauſe <hi>we may have been ſharers in them.</hi> St. <hi>Paul</hi> adviſeth <hi>Timothy</hi> well, (and in him, every Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian) not to be <hi>partaker of other mens ſins:</hi> but have <hi>we</hi> followed this advice? Perhaps we may not have commanded, or counſelled them to ſin; we may not have urg'd, provoked, or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly enticed or tempted them to ſin. But there are <hi>other</hi> ways, whereby we may partake of others ſins. Thus, we may have connived at it, or flattered them in it; we may not have warned them againſt it, or reproved them for it: but inſtead of all this, by our ill Example, we may have powerfully invited, and encoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged them to it. Now if by <hi>all,</hi> or <hi>any</hi> of theſe means, we have ever been acceſſary to others ſins; we have great Reaſon to <hi>mourn deeply</hi> for them. Yea, as great Reaſon as we have to mourn for <hi>our own.</hi> For look how far we have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed to them, and ſo far they are ours as much as theirs: or at leaſt they are ours in too great a meaſure.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>The <hi>firſt Aggravation</hi> of <hi>our own</hi> and <hi>others Sins,</hi> conſidered as the <hi>firſt Sua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive</hi> to Mourning for the ſame: <hi>We have ſinned againſt the greateſt LIGHT.</hi> As againſt the <hi>Light</hi> of <hi>Conſcience.</hi> Of the <hi>SPIRIT.</hi> Of the <hi>Word.</hi> Of <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience.</hi> Of <hi>Ordinances.</hi> Of <hi>Examples</hi> Of <hi>Admonitions.</hi> And of <hi>humane Laws.</hi>

               </argument>
               <p>AFter <hi>Reaſons</hi> for Mourning for our <hi>own,</hi> and <hi>others</hi> Sins; <hi>Suaſives</hi> to the Work will here follow in their proper place. And to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuade to this, what can be more effectual, than a thorough <hi>conviction</hi> of our <hi>exceeding ſinfulneſs?</hi> And to convince us of that, we cannot do bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than take a <hi>ſerious view</hi> of ſome of the moſt hainous and affecting <hi>Aggravations</hi> of our <hi>own,</hi> and <hi>other mens</hi> Sins. Of theſe <hi>Aggravations,</hi> I recommend but <hi>Three,</hi> as ſo many <hi>Suaſives</hi> to Mourning for <hi>both.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Firſt</hi> is this, <hi>We have ſinned againſt the</hi> greateſt Light. Men in the dark may eaſily miſtake, and either <hi>do,</hi> or <hi>go</hi> amiſs. But then they have a good excuſe for it, as wanting <hi>Light,</hi> the common Guide in all external Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Actions. But in our <hi>moral</hi> Miſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages, we were never deſtitute of ſuch Directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and ſo <hi>they'll</hi> admit of no ſuch Apology. It was not through any <hi>want</hi> of Light, but through our <hi>neglect,</hi> or evil <hi>contempt</hi> of it, that we have run into the Works of Darkneſs. And whereas
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:34484:144"/> want of Light would have mitigated our Guilt, the plenty of it which we have always injoyed, does mightily heighten it. For in ſinning againſt GOD, we have gone unworthily againſt the greateſt Light, which could reaſonably be af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forded us here in our preſent ſtate and circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances. This will plainly appear if we look into the <hi>Eight</hi> Particulars that follow. And.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> We have ſinned againſt <hi>the Light of</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience. When we have been ready to run out of the way of Righteouſneſs, and fooliſhly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clin'd to commit Iniquity; <hi>Conſcience</hi> hath ſtood up in oppoſition to us, and attempted to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der us. It hath friendly ſmitten us, and flown in our faces, and with very kind and officious checks, hath warned us againſt the Evils we were about. And when with all our Arts we could not drown its Voice, nor ſtifle its Sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtions, nor quiet its Clamours, nor ſilence its loud, tho' ſecret Diſſuaſions; we have froward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and forcibly broken through them all, ruſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into ſin, as an horſe into Battel. Do we not remember that it hath been thus with us? When we have been lingring after any pleaſing Sin, and juſt ſtepping into the Perpetration of it; hath not <hi>Conſcience</hi> riſen up, and like a faithful Monitreſs rounded us in the Ear with proper and ſeaſonable Cautions againſt it? Hath She not plainly told us? (tho' not with an audible articulate Voice) <hi>this</hi> is evil, and <hi>that</hi> is forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den; <hi>here</hi> ye will offend GOD, and <hi>there</hi> ye will diſhonour CHRIST, <hi>thus</hi> ye may en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>danger, and <hi>ſo</hi> ye may undoe your immortal Souls. When we have been juſt upon the point of doing fooliſhly, and running unadviſedly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Regions of Death; hath not <hi>Conſcience</hi> thus
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:34484:144"/> gently reproved us, and made us feel and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs her Rebukes to be good? Inſomuch that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed it hath been uneaſy to reſiſt them, and a very great Pain and Trouble to us, to go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt ſuch clear and ſtrong Convictions. But did all this work upon us, or did it at all pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail with us? When <hi>Conſcience</hi> hath thus haunted us from Day to Day, and Her light hath fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed us from Place to Place, and hath ſhown us the Deadlineſs of our reſpective ſins, from Time to Time; hath this cauſed us to ceaſe from them? O no, we have been ſo far from making that due uſe of this excellent <hi>Light,</hi> that we have rather wiſht it quite out, that ſo we might ſin with more Pleaſure, and leſs Relu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctancy, And when it was not in our Power to extinguiſh it wretchedly, but in ſpite of all we could do, it would glare us in the face, we have walked perverſely and prophanely againſt it, ſinning Preſumptuouſly in defiance to that Light, which GOD ſet up to keep us from Sin.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> We have ſinned <hi>againſt the Light of the</hi> SPIRIT. When Conſcience prov'd too weak to reſtrain us, the gracious GOD hath ſtruck in with the ſuaſions of His Bleſſed SPI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RIT, to turn us off from our vitious Practices. And with what ſweet but cogent Arguments hath He ſometimes ſet upon us? When we have hankered after unreaſonable Extravagancies, and have been fit to plunge our ſelves into Perditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for the injoyment of them; how watchfully and lovingly hath He appli'd himſelf to us, in theſe, or the like ſoft and compaſſionate Whiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, to check and ſtop us in our unhappy Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dencies.</p>
               <pb n="276" facs="tcp:34484:145"/>
               <p>O raſh and inconſiderate Creature! art thou tampering again with thy dangerous Luſts, and ready to reembrace thy fatal Sins? It is but a while ſince through ſuch Follies, GOD found thee in a moſt rufull Plight. Defiled with Guilt, overwhelmed with Grief, dejected with Doubts, aſtoniſht with Fears, confounded with ſhame, and by many woful but deſerved Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtractions, brought almoſt to the brink of Deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair. Then (as thou canſt not chuſe but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member) His Mercy piti'd thee, and in Pity He relieved thee. He pardoned thee by His Grace, and refreſhed thee with His Comforts, and reſtored unto thee the Joy of his Salvation, upon thy penitent humbling of thy ſelf before Him. And art thou now diſpoſed to apoſtatize from Him, and rebelliouſly to kick againſt Him afreſh? Is this the amends He ſhall have for His Goodneſs? Haſt thou forgot the Smart of thy old Impieties that thou art ſo forward to liſten to new Temptations? Did Satan uſe thee ſo well, when thou wert laſt in his hands, that thou art willing to come into his hateful Power, and under his helliſh Tyranny again? Or was GOD ſo hard a Maſter to thee, that thou art ſo prone to deſert His Service? Judge for thy ſelf in the caſe: hadſt thou not much Peace, and many Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, when thou walkeſt uprightly with thy GOD? And hadſt thou not as much trouble, and as many torments, when you joinedſt with His and thine own Enemies? When thou was laſt at a Diſtance from Him, and under His Diſpleaſure; didſt thou not promiſe, that if He would return, and be reconciled to Thee, thou wouldſt be cautious and circumſpect, and take more care off offending Him than ever? And did
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:34484:145"/> He not condeſcend to the meaſures thou de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiredſt? Did He not hear thy Complaint, and accept thy Vow, and ſnatch thee from thy Woes, and lay thee in His Boſom, and renew thy Delights, and give thee competent Aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of His regained Favour? And ſilly Wretch! art thou now relinquiſhing this GOD, and reſigning thy Happineſs, to lie down and wallow in repeated Wickedneſs?</p>
               <p>I appeal to Chriſtians, hath it not been thus? Hath not the good SPIRIT very often thus contended with us, and by his ſacred Strugglings ſought to check the fire of our kindling Luſts, and ſo prevent its breaking out into flames of Sin? Not that He hath ſpoken theſe very <hi>words</hi> diſtinctly to our Ears; but He hath darted ſuch <hi>Thoughts</hi> as theſe into our Minds, which is <hi>His way</hi> of ſpeaking to Men. Nor hath He barely ſuggeſted them to us, but ſet them <hi>home</hi> upon us, cauſing them to dwell in us ſo long, and ſo powerfully to work with us, as throughly to convince us of the Naughtineſs of thoſe things we were about to attempt. But when all this was done, it could not reſtrain or keep us from our <hi>ſins;</hi> which renders them moſt horrid and provoking.</p>
               <p>And as it hath been with many in this caſe, ſo, I fear, it may be ſtill. The SPIRIT of GOD pleads hard with them, but alas He ſpeaks to the deafeſt in the World, even to a People that <hi>will not</hi> hear. I mean, that will not hear his charming Inſinuations, ſo as duly to regard them, and be influenc'd by them. O let them whoſe unhappy Temper and Carriage this is, take all the care that poſſibly they can, to rectify the ſame. If they do not, their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:34484:146"/> may prove extremely ſad. For then that divine and loving SPIRIT, who hath ſtriven ſo <hi>much,</hi> and ſtriven ſo <hi>long,</hi> will not continue to do it <hi>always,</hi> when He thus finds it to be in vain. And if once He ceaſes His ſweet Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicts with us, by reaſon of our affronting Him; and gives us up to follow our vitious Inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, becauſe we grieve and quench Him by Stubborn reſiſtance; what will become of us? The Curb that held us in, being taken off us, we ſhall preſently fall to committing ſin with <hi>greedineſs,</hi> (even all the Sins that we like and love) to GOD's Diſhonour, and the eternal Ruine of our Immortal Souls. And muſt not ſuch be in a lamentable Plight? They that are in it, I confeſs, are oft-times <hi>inſenſible</hi> of it: They do not diſcern, nor do they conſider it. But then for this they are not the <hi>leſs,</hi> but the <hi>more</hi> miſerable, as being indeed the more like to periſh. They think they are ſafe, and they conclude they ſhall be happy, and ſo of all living on the face of the Earth, are moſt ſure to be undone; becauſe when they are in the very Jaws of Perdition, they do not <hi>perceive</hi> that they are in Danger. If therefore we love or value our Souls, let us fear and tremble to go on in ſin againſt this <hi>Light</hi> of the Bleſſed SPIRIT.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> We have ſinned <hi>againſt the Light of the</hi> Word. <hi>Thy Word is a Light, Pſal.</hi> 119.105. And ſo bright and glorious a Light it is, that it makes a moſt perfect Diſcovery of ſin. For it ſhows us the Vanity and Vileneſs of it, together with the heavy Curſe that attends it, and its ſad and direful Effects in this Life. And it ſhows us the horrible Threatnings againſt it,
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:34484:146"/> and the hideous Plagues and Puniſhments of it, in the State of future eternal Sufferings, into which it will ſink all final Impenitents. And yet we have ſinned againſt <hi>this Light</hi> too, and that as boldly as if it had never ſhined amongſt us.</p>
               <p>Nor does the Word only ſhow the <hi>Evil</hi> of Sin in <hi>Groſs,</hi> and the Menaces that lie againſt it in <hi>General:</hi> but moreover it deſcends to <hi>Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar</hi> Tranſgreſſions, pointing out the Evil of <hi>them,</hi> by threatning reſpective <hi>Penalties</hi> to them, or to the Actors and Abettors of them. Thus it ſhows the Evil of <hi>Pride: Pride goeth before De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, and an haughty Spirit before a Fall, Prov.</hi> 16.18. Of <hi>Carnality; if ye live after the Fleſh, ye ſhall dye, Rom.</hi> 8.13.

               <p>Can any things be more plainly told us than theſe? Can they be ſet in a clearer Light be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore us? But then if we will not believe what we plainly ſee; or if our Faith be too weak to ſway our Practice, and we do not take due care to ſtrengthen it; this muſt greatly <hi>aggravate</hi> our

What fair Caveats againſt loving it; what faithful Warnings againſt committing it; what mighty Dehortations from continuing in it; have we there met with? And theſe have ſometimes gone very near us. They have touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed us to the Quick, and pricked us to the Heart; they have ſtartled our Spirits, and rowzed our Minds, and awakened our Conſciences, and to our thinking have turned us entirely from our Naughtineſs. For hereupon we have fully re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved, and frequently determined, to renounce all looſe and ſinful Ways, and to enter upon a ſtricter Courſe of Living. But how long hath this laſted? Perhaps by that time the Preacher had done Speaking, we had done Reſolving, and the very next Temptation hath foiled us as eaſily, and vanquiſht us as ſhamefully as any did before. And when notwithſtanding thoſe fatal Hooks which Satan covers with alluring Baits, be thus plainly ſhown us by skilful Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters; we yet catch at them readily when he offers them again, and ſwallow them down with delight and greedineſs: muſt not this be another <hi>Aggravation</hi> of our Sinfulneſs, and a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſad one? Believe it, it will double our Folly and our Guilt; and they will double our Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to us, or elſe the Difficulty of our Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.</p>
               <pb n="281" facs="tcp:34484:147"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>If I had not ſpoken to them, they had not had ſin; but now they have no Cloke for their ſin,</hi> ſaid our Dear LORD, <hi>Joh.</hi> 15.22. So if GOD had not <hi>ſpoken</hi> in his <hi>Word preached,</hi> and ſpoken to us ſo plainly, conſtantly, and vehemently; we ſhould not have had the ſin which we now have, for it would have been conſiderably <hi>leſs</hi> than it is. But now our Contempt hath been bold, and our Contumacy high, and we have nothing to excuſe or extenuate either. It may be hundreds, thouſands, millions of Souls have been reclaimed from Sin, and brought over to Righteouſneſs, by <hi>half</hi> thoſe divine pathetic Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes, which we have ſat under and ſullenly withſtood; and which ſtill perhaps we deſpiſe, and reſiſt. And when we were otherwiſe <hi>bad,</hi> this cannot but render us a great deal <hi>worſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> We have ſinned againſt <hi>the Light of</hi> Experience. We have felt the <hi>Sweetneſs</hi> of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocence, and the <hi>Joys</hi> of Holineſs, and the <hi>Pleaſures</hi> of Obedience, and the <hi>Comforts</hi> of a good Conſcience: and we have ſinned againſt <hi>theſe.</hi> And on the other ſide, we have been ſenſible of the <hi>vanity</hi> of Diſſoluteneſs, and the <hi>trouble</hi> of Irreligion, and the <hi>bitterneſs</hi> of Impiety, and the <hi>terrors</hi> and <hi>torments</hi> of a guilty Mind: and we have ſinned againſt <hi>theſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt, We have ſinned againſt the <hi>Sweetneſs of Innocence,</hi> and the <hi>Joys of Holineſs.</hi> When we have walked in Uprightneſs before GOD, how often, and how graciouſly hath He met us? and what pleaſing Effects hath His gracious Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence had upon us? It hath filled us ſtrangely with divine Peace, and inflamed us mightily
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:34484:148"/> with divine Love, and both together have ſo wrought with us, and indear'd Him to us; that we have been all on fire with Zeal for His Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour. We have immediately vow'd all Fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity to His MAJESTY, and devoted our whole Life to His Glory and Worſhip. We have nobly reſolved, not only to ſpend our <hi>Time,</hi> but our <hi>Bloud</hi> for His Intereſt; and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to dye in His Service, than once yield to ſin. But hath this held on? No alas, we have ſoon relaps'd into our former deadneſs, and our wonted indiſpoſition to Virtue and Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs. Our Zeal hath been ſurpriz'd with ſudden Chilneſs; and our hot Reſolutions of doing GOD's Will, have grown quite Cold. Nay, which is worſe, the Stream it may be, hath not only thus ſtopped with us, but turned the clean contrary way. Our Reſolutions for Piety, have changed into ſtiff Inclinations to Naughtineſs; and we have purſued Evil with as much eagerneſs, as before we intended to practiſe Godlineſs. And muſt not this again notoriouſly <hi>aggravate</hi> our Wickedneſs? To cloſe with Satan, and conſent to Sin, and plunge our ſelves headlong into hainous Guilt, when we have taſted the Delights of Innocence and San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctity; cannot but heighten the Degrees of our Baſeneſs, and help very much towards filling up the meaſures of our growing Iniquities.</p>
               <p>When we lived well, and kept on in an even Courſe of Religion; if the Pains we took, had not been recompenc'd with holy <hi>Pleaſures,</hi> we might then have remitted of our pious Strict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; and when we became careleſs, might have thought our ſelves the leſs culpable. But which of us can take up ſuch a Plea in his own De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence,
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:34484:148"/> and truly alledge, that he was looſe or licentious, becauſe he found no <hi>Delights</hi> in Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs? Can any Juſtly complain, that Duties (rightly performed by us) were dry, and bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren, and empty things? No, no, ſo long as we adher'd to GOD, and lived in his Fear; He ſtill fed us with ſpiritual <hi>ſatisfactions;</hi> and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps with <hi>too many.</hi> For meer plenty of theſe may have made us the more negligent. And had <hi>He</hi> been leſs kind and liberal in this caſe, <hi>we</hi> might have been more careful and ſedulous. But like unworthy and ingrateful Servants, we abated of our Work, becauſe our great Maſter raiſed our Wages.</p>
               <p>Secondly, We have ſinned againſt our <hi>Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience</hi> of the <hi>Bitterneſs of Sin,</hi> and the <hi>Troubles and Terrors</hi> occaſion'd by its <hi>Guilt.</hi> To how ruful a Condition hath our Impiety oft-times reduc'd us? As the Prophet complains, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 59.2; it <hi>hath ſeparated between us and our</hi> GOD, <hi>and hath Hid His face from us.</hi> And beſides depriving us of His <hi>Preſence,</hi> and His <hi>Countenance,</hi> it hath laid us under a deep ſenſe of His diſpleaſure, and made us to drink of the Phials of His Wrath, and the Cup of His Fury. And this hath ſunk us ſo far below Hopes of Heaven, as to ſet us down, as it were in the Gates, or Suburbs of Hell; where we could look for nothing but eternal Vengeance, and a lamentable Portion in the Lot of Reprobates. And when Sin hath brought us to this ſad paſs, and we have felt its inſupportable Weight and Torment: then what heavy Sighs, what earneſt Prayers, what ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowful <hi>Tears</hi> hath it wrung from us? Then what Vows of Repentance, what Promiſes of Amendment, what Reſolutions of abſtaining
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:34484:149"/> perpetually from Sin, have we made; if GOD would but pleaſe to relieve us <hi>in,</hi> or to releaſe us <hi>from</hi> our uneaſy Circumſtances? Or if we have not done thus in time of our Health, yet when Sickneſs hath ſeized us, and Weakneſs un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dermined us, and Death (to our thinking) hath been drawing near us, or ſtanding by us, ready to arreſt us, and carry us before the ſupreme Judge, from whom we have dreaded a ſevere Sentence for our unrepented Crimes: then I am ſure we had a killing ſenſe of the <hi>Bitterneſs</hi> of Sin, and fully purpoſed to have no more to do with it upon any terms in caſe of Recovery. But when our gracious GOD moſt kindly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored us, and put us upon the trial; have we throughly performed what we undertook? Have we ſtood to our Purpoſes, and fulfilled our Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, and kept our Vows, and Reſolutions in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>violate? So far from that, that it may be we have no ſooner been cured of our Sickneſs, but we have immediately relapſed into our Sins. We have<note n="*" place="margin">2 Pet. 2.22.</note> 
                  <hi>returned</hi> (according to the Scripture-Proverb) <hi>with the Dog to His Vomit; and with the Sow that was waſhed, to wallowing in the Mire.</hi> And is not this a moſt grievous <hi>Aggravation</hi> of our ſinfulneſs?</p>
               <p>I may here add, that we have not only ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned againſt our <hi>own perſonal</hi> Experience of the <hi>Bitterneſs</hi> of Sin; but alſo againſt the <hi>declared Experience</hi> of <hi>others.</hi> For ſome of our Friends perhaps, or ſeveral of our Neighbours, when they have been well in health, have made as light of Sin, as we. But when we have ſeen them ſick, they have cried out of their Miſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages, and complained of their Guilt, and wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed themſeves innocent, and would have given
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:34484:149"/> the whole World they might have liv'd but ſo long, as to have made their Peace with GOD, and become better Men. And at the ſame time they have ſorrowfully owned, that ſhould Death ſnatch them hence without farther reſpite, they were unfit for it, and ſhould be moſt miſerably undone by it, through ſuch and ſuch preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous Tranſgreſſions. But for all this, Death hath then prevailed, and we have beheld them dye, and dye moſt piteouſly. That is, with Reluctancy and Unwillingneſs, with Doubts and Scrupuloſity, with much Fear and mighty Terrors, and trembling Apprehenſions and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazements. And when GOD cut them off, and removed them out of this World, how He receiv'd, and where He plac'd them in the next; we cannot tell, or we muſt not ſay. But what hath been the <hi>Effect</hi> of this upon our ſelves? Why, we have ſometimes ſeriouſly thought of the Accidents, and ſolemnly reflected on the lowring Providences, and the Spectacles of this Nature have occaſion'd ſome Grief and Tears unto us. In ſhort, we have remembred the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy Perſons with ſadneſs, and have talked of them a few days with melancholy, and told thoſe about us we ſhould never forget them. But yet within a while after their Burial, all this (as to good Purpoſes) was as much out of our Minds, as the Parties deceas'd were out of our Sight. Yea, which is ſtrangely and horribly worſe, it may be we have audaciouſly commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ſuch Sins, as they ſo much exclaimed of, and were ſo extremely diſordered with, if not everlaſtingly undone by. And whether our ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning thus againſt <hi>others</hi> Experience of the <hi>Bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terneſs</hi> of Sin, be not a fearful <hi>Aggravation</hi> of,
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:34484:150"/> our Guilt; let any competent Judge deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fifthly,</hi> We have ſinned againſt <hi>the Light of</hi> Ordinances. As of <hi>Baptiſm, Prayer,</hi> and the <hi>Sacrament of the</hi> LORD's <hi>Supper;</hi> to name no more.</p>
               <p n="1">1ſt, Againſt <hi>Baptiſm.</hi> One main End of it, is to cleanſe us from Sin by a myſtical Waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, typifi'd and repreſented by Dipping or Sprinkling with elementary Water, uſed in the religious Celebration of it. And ſo it is a Light that clearly ſhows the <hi>moral Filth</hi> and <hi>Pollution</hi> of Sin. Had it not abominable <hi>Defilement</hi> in it, ſuch a <hi>Lavatory</hi> had never been provided. And in the ſame Ordinance by our ſelves, or Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, we openly renounce the Devil, and all his Works; the vain Pomp and Glory of the World, with all the covetous Deſires of the ſame, and the carnal Deſires of the Fleſh, ſo as not to follow, or be led by them. But inſtead of that, ingage manfully to fight under CHRIST's Banner, againſt Sin, and to continue His faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Souldiers to our Live's end. And thus it is a Light again, that clearly ſhows the <hi>Danger,</hi> and <hi>Deſtructiveneſs</hi> of Sin. For were it not of perillous and moſt pernicious Conſequence to our Souls, why ſhould we enter into ſuch a ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred <hi>Covenant</hi> of Abjuring and Oppoſing it, to our laſt Breath? But then how ſhould the flaſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of this Light in our Conſciences, deter and drive us from all wilful Tranſgreſſions?</p>
               <p n="2">2ly, We have ſinned againſt <hi>Prayer.</hi> This Ordinance gives great Light into the Vileneſs, and Deadlineſs of Sin. For in it we explicitly confeſs our Sins, and confeſs them to be moſt <hi>grievous</hi> things: hainous in <hi>themſelves,</hi> provoking
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:34484:150"/> to GOD, and baneful unto <hi>us.</hi> That they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe us at once, to temporal Miſeries, ſpiritual Judgments, and eternal Puniſhments. And therefore in this Ordinance we earneſtly beg that GOD's SPIRIT, and Grace, and Power, and Providence, may reſcue us from Sin, and ſecure us againſt it, for the time to come; as well as that His Mercy may Pardon what is paſt. And when to GOD AL<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MIGHTY, in the Preſence of His Angels, we make ſuch humble Acknowledgments, and importunate Requeſts; and that deliberately and devoutly, publicly and privately, daily and continually; if then we ſtill run on in Sin, we muſt needs go againſt a very <hi>clear Light.</hi> A Light ſo bright and ſtrong, as will not fail to turn into <hi>fire.</hi> Either into the fire of Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance and Zeal, or into that of a tormenting Conſcience. The latter of which if we do not extinguiſh it while we live; when we dye, will turn to thoſe unquenchable Flames, which will burn us for ever, but not conſume us.</p>
               <p n="3">3ly, We have ſinned againſt <hi>the Sacrament of the</hi> LORD's <hi>Supper.</hi> This methinks ſends forth ſuch Beams of Light, as ſhould quite turn our Eyes from looking after Impiety. For it ſhows as much <hi>terror</hi> to <hi>Sinners</hi> as can be exhibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, by ſhowing as much <hi>ſeverity</hi> againſt <hi>Sin</hi> as can be expreſſed. For here we ſee the Body of the SON of GOD, by bearing our Sins on the Tree, broken: and His precious Bloud, for the Remiſſion of our Sins, ſhed. And can Men, or Angels, or GOD Himſelf, invent a mightier Diſcouragement from Sin? Yet we have not only ſinned <hi>under</hi> this Diſcouragement, but directly <hi>againſt</hi> it; even againſt this very
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:34484:151"/> 
                  <hi>Ordinance.</hi> For either we have not come at it, <hi>at all,</hi> or elſe not ſo <hi>frequently</hi> as we might, or elſe not ſo <hi>worthily</hi> as we ought.</p>
               <p>Now is not this a monſtrous <hi>Aggravation</hi> of our ſinfulneſs; thus to ſin againſt the Light of <hi>Ordinances?</hi> I know not what to ſay to it, nor yet to them that are guilty of it better than this. Beg of GOD to give you true Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance for your great Offences, that ye may ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver relapſe into the ſame.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sixthly,</hi> We have ſinned againſt <hi>the Light of</hi> Examples. Examples are of two ſorts, <hi>Active,</hi> and <hi>Paſſive.</hi> By <hi>Active</hi> Examples, I mean the Examples of ſuch as have been <hi>noted</hi> for doing their <hi>Duties.</hi> By <hi>Paſſive</hi> ones, ſuch as have been remarkable in <hi>ſuffering</hi> from GOD, for <hi>Diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience.</hi> Plenty of <hi>both</hi> Occurrs in Scripture, and afford conſiderable <hi>Lights</hi> reſpectively. <hi>Active</hi> Examples yield a Light of <hi>Encouragement,</hi> to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vite and draw us to things that are worthy. <hi>Paſſive</hi> Examples, a Light of <hi>Determent,</hi> to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrange and beat us off from unlawful Practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. <hi>Both,</hi> I ſay, are ſet down in the ſacred Books, to theſe very Purpoſes.</p>
               <p>That they recommend <hi>Active</hi> Examples to us, to the End aforeſaid, is evident, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 51.3. <hi>Look unto</hi> Abraham <hi>your Father, and unto</hi> Sarah <hi>that bare you; for I called Him alone, and bleſſed him, and increaſed him.</hi> So that Examples of <hi>Piety,</hi> and of GOD's Bleſſing upon them that practiſe it; are notified in the holy Volume, that we may look at them, and be influenc'd by them. And the ſame is true of <hi>Paſſive</hi> Examples; as appears, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.6. <hi>Now theſe things were our</hi> Examples, <hi>to the intent we ſhould not luſt after evil things, as they alſo luſted.</hi> Which
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:34484:151"/> being ſpoken of the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> who periſhed in the Wilderneſs, for their high Provocations; plainly ſhows, that Examples of <hi>Lewdneſs,</hi> and of GOD's ſevere Judgments upon the Impi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous; are filed up by Heaven, as Warnings to us. As awful Warnings to keep us from ruſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into thoſe Sins, which have ruined others.</p>
               <p>But then lo <hi>another ſad Aggravation</hi> of our ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs; that we have ſinned againſt both theſe kinds of <hi>Examples</hi> at once.</p>
               <p n="1">1ſt, Againſt the Light of <hi>Active Examples.</hi> Thus, as many of us as have been incredulous, or unbelieving, have ſinned againſt the Light of <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Example; who <hi>againſt hope believed in hope.</hi> As many as have been <hi>Fierce</hi> and <hi>Choleric,</hi> and guilty of cauſeleſs or exceſſive <hi>Anger;</hi> have ſinned againſt the Light of <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Example; who was of a moſt quiet and gentle Temper, and for<note n="*" place="margin">Numb. 12.13.</note> 
                  <hi>meekneſs</hi> incomparable. As many as have been <hi>peeviſh</hi> and <hi>ſullen, murmuring</hi> and <hi>diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contented</hi> under Troubles and Afflictions; have ſinned againſt the Light of <hi>Job</hi>'s Example: Who did not only bear his Adverſities with Patience, but with great<note n="†" place="margin">Job 1.21.</note> 
                  <hi>Thankfulneſs.</hi> As many as have <hi>wronged, oppreſſed,</hi> or <hi>defrauded</hi> their Brethren; have ſinned againſt the Light of <hi>Samuel</hi>'s Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample: Who tho' he was great in Power, was of equal Integrity. For when he reſign'd the Government of <hi>Iſrael</hi> to <hi>Saul,</hi> he declar'd he had never been injurious to any; and juſtifi'd the honourable Declaration, he made, by a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic<note n="‖" place="margin">1 Sam. 12.3.</note> Appeal to GOD, the King, and the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple at once. As many as have <hi>abſented</hi> from the Worſhip of GOD, and neglected to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend the Duties of His Houſe; have ſinned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:34484:152"/> the Light of <hi>Anna</hi>'s Example: who not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the Infirmities of extreme Age (as being about <hi>fourſcore and four years old) * departed not from the Temple, but ſerved</hi> GOD <hi>with Faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and Prayers, night and day.</hi> As many as have <hi>not educated</hi> their <hi>Children</hi> piouſly, and <hi>inſtructed</hi> their <hi>Servants</hi> virtuouſly, and <hi>taught</hi> their <hi>Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies</hi> religiouſly; injoining them to love, and fear, and worſhip GOD: have ſinned againſt the Light of <hi>his</hi> Example, who was the Father of the Faithful. Of whom the HOLY GHOST hath thus pronounced; <hi>I know him, that he will * command his Children, and his Houſhold after him; and they ſhall keep the way of the</hi> LORD. As many as have fallen into any <hi>known</hi> and <hi>preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous Crime,</hi> and have not been <hi>troubled</hi> at it, and <hi>afflicted</hi> for it, and <hi>cut</hi> and <hi>wounded</hi> to the heart by it, and by ſincere Repentance <hi>raiſed</hi> out of it; have ſinned againſt the Light of <hi>many</hi> fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Examples; as of <hi>Sampſon, David, Manaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeh,</hi> S. <hi>Peter,</hi> S. <hi>Paul, Mary Magdalen,</hi> &amp;c. who being hainous and notorious Offenders, became as humble and hearty Penitents. As many as have been <hi>defective</hi> in Duty, and <hi>ſhort</hi> of GOD's Glory, by not walking up to the Rules of the Goſpel, and the Laws of that excellent Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on we profeſs; have ſinned againſt the Light of thoſe memorable Examples, which <hi>they</hi> have ſet us, who ſtand upon record for <hi>ſtrict</hi> and <hi>zealous</hi> Worſhippers of the DEITY, and fervent Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers of the Adorable LORD JESUS. Yea, we have ſinned againſt JESUS's own Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, who as He came to do his FATHER's Will, ſo He did it moſt fully and faithfully, and therein was a great and glorious <hi>Pattern</hi> to His whole Church, obliging every true Member
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:34484:152"/> of the ſame, to a laudable Imitation of Himſelf.</p>
               <p>Now ſuch eminent <hi>Active</hi> Examples as theſe, being fairly entred in the ſacred Regiſter, on purpoſe that we might view and imitate them; for us to ſin againſt the <hi>Light</hi> of <hi>obedience</hi> which they afford, muſt needs be a Monſtrous <hi>Aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation</hi> of our ſinfulneſs; and in the Days of our Repentance or ſorrow for Sin, ought to be Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred with much <hi>Bitterneſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2ly. We have ſinned againſt <hi>the Light of</hi> Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive <hi>Examples.</hi> Nothing being ſo fatal to us as <hi>Sin,</hi> it hath ever been the Deſign of our gracious GOD, to keep us from it, by all the methods of Wiſdom and Goodneſs, applicable that way, and conducive to that End. And to this purpoſe, He hath ſet <hi>Paſſive,</hi> as well as <hi>Active</hi> Examples be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore us. That ſo others ſufferings might be a Warning to us, and we might learn to be wiſe by their Woes, while the Sight of their Miſeries iſſuing from their Sins, might preſerve <hi>us</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent. But we Wretches would not be ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained. But have broken the Barrs of theſe ſtrong Impediments, and torn thoſe Bands of aw in pieces, and have ſinned daringly in <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt</hi> and <hi>ſcorn,</hi> if not in <hi>deſpight</hi> of the great Diſcouragements.</p>
               <p>Thus, as many amongſt us as have been guilty of <hi>Murder,</hi> have ſinned againſt the Light of <hi>Cain</hi>'s Example, who ſuffered hideouſly for that Sin. For beſides the<note n="*" place="margin">Gen. 4.12.</note> 
                  <hi>Curſe</hi> pronounced on the Earth (upon his ſhedding his Brother <hi>Abel</hi>'s Bloud) which brought a <hi>father Barrenneſs</hi> into it, than that which befell it for <hi>Adam</hi>'s tranſgreſſion: he was driven from GOD's<note n="†" place="margin">v. 14.</note>

He was kept under ſad con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſternations of Mind; afflicted with ſuch black Apprehenſions of Dying, and affrighted with ſuch woful horrors of Death, that he verily thought every one that ſaw him would certainly<note n="*" place="margin">ib.</note> kill him. But that he might live miſerably to the terror of men, and to keep them from venturing upon the like Wickedneſs; GOD ſet a<note n="†" place="margin">
                     <hi>Note</hi> VII.</note> dreadful Mark upon him, that none might<note n="‖" place="margin">v. 15.</note> dare to diſpatch him. That ſo he might live <hi>in terrorem,</hi> to fright others, from ſo great a Sin, by the puniſhment which he ſuffered. As many as have been guilty of <hi>Adultery,</hi> have ſinned againſt the Light of <hi>David</hi>'s Example, who ſuffered grievouſly for that Sin. Inwardly, in his Spirit; and outwardly in Judgments, which fell heavy upon him. His inward Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings ſhow themſelves in ſorrowful complaints, which he makes aloud in the <hi>Penitential Pſalms.</hi> There he ſtands, as it were in a white ſheet, and does open Penance for his groſs Miſcarri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages: giving the World clearly to underſtand, what he felt in his Mind, for the Enormities of his Life. In the 6th <hi>Pſalm</hi> he complains of <hi>vexed Bones,</hi> and a <hi>troubled Soul;</hi> of <hi>weary Groans,</hi> and a <hi>waſhed Bed;</hi> of a <hi>watred Couch,</hi> and a <hi>worn-out Beauty.</hi> In the two and thirtieth <hi>Pſalm,</hi> of <hi>Bones conſumed</hi> by his aſſiduous <hi>Roaring.</hi> Of the <hi>hand of</hi> GOD that was <hi>heavy</hi> upon him; heavy upon him <hi>day and night;</hi> ſo heavy, that it quite <hi>drank up</hi> his natural <hi>moiſture,</hi> and made it like to the <hi>Drought in ſummer.</hi> The Anguiſh of his Soul inflamed his Bloud, and the Feveriſhneſs of his Bloud parch'd up his Body. In the thirty eighth <hi>Pſalm</hi> he makes piteous Lamentations, and ſeeks to eaſe himſelf in very piercing and
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:34484:153"/> pathetic Out-cries. He exclaims that the <hi>Arrows</hi> of the LORD <hi>ſtuck faſt in him,</hi> and that <hi>his Hand preſſed him ſore.</hi> That there was <hi>no Health in his Fleſh,</hi> becauſe of GOD's <hi>Diſpleaſure,</hi> nor Reſt in <hi>his Bones,</hi> by <hi>reaſon of his Sins.</hi> That his <hi>Fooliſhneſs</hi> had brought <hi>ſtinking Diſeaſes</hi> upon him, and that the grievous pain and noiſomneſs of them did ſo afflict him, that he went about <hi>mourning</hi> all the Day long. That he was <hi>ſmitten</hi> with <hi>Feebleneſs,</hi> and <hi>roared</hi> for <hi>Diſquietneſs.</hi> That his <hi>Heart panted,</hi> and His <hi>Strength failed,</hi> and the <hi>Sight</hi> of his Eyes was <hi>gone</hi> from Him. And ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly he muſt undergo direful things, that could be attended with ſuch diſmal Symptoms.</p>
               <p>And beſides theſe woful Miſeries within, he lay under the Scourge of <hi>external Judgments,</hi> which was terribly ſharp and cutting to him. GOD threatned to raiſe up <hi>evil</hi> againſt him out of his <hi>own houſe;</hi> and what He thus mena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, in the Event He made good. For His Daughter <hi>Tamar</hi> was wickedly raviſht by his Son <hi>Amnon:</hi> and His <hi>Concubines</hi> abuſed, and that ſhamefully and publicly by his Son <hi>Abſolom.</hi> And theſe were lamentable, tho' proper Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of his ſcandalous <hi>defilement</hi> of <hi>Bathſheba;</hi> as the Death of <hi>Amnon,</hi> and the Rebellion and untimely End of <hi>Abſolom;</hi> were of his <hi>murdering</hi> her Husband <hi>Uriah.</hi> As many as have been guilty of <hi>Fornication,</hi> have ſinned againſt the Light of <hi>Zimri</hi>'s and <hi>Cosbi</hi>'s Example; who were both deſtroyed in committing it. And againſt the Light of <hi>Sampſon</hi>'s Example; who by means of his lewd Paramour, firſt loſt his <hi>Innocence,</hi> then his <hi>Strength,</hi> then his <hi>Liberty,</hi> then his <hi>Eyes,</hi> and at laſt his Life. As many as have been guilty of <hi>rebelling</hi> againſt lawful <hi>Magiſtracy,</hi> or of <hi>uſurping</hi>
                  <pb n="264" facs="tcp:34484:154"/> and invading the holy <hi>Miniſtery,</hi> have ſinned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Light of <hi>Korah</hi>'s, <hi>Dathan</hi>'s, and <hi>Abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ram</hi>'s Example; who together with their ſchiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical and ſeditious Accomplices, for thoſe ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Crimes, were either ſwallowed up<note n="*" place="margin">Numb. 16.31, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </note> alive of the gaping Earth; or conſumed by devouring Fire from Heaven. As many as have been guilty of <hi>Drunkenneſs,</hi> have ſinned againſt the Light of <hi>Noah</hi>'s and <hi>Lot</hi>'s Example: The firſt of which,<note n="†" place="margin">Gen. 19.21, 22.</note> by <hi>Intemperance,</hi> was expos'd to great <hi>ſhame;</hi> and the ſecond drawn into an abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble<note n="‖" place="margin">Gen. 19.36.</note> 
                  <hi>ſin.</hi> As many as have been guilty of <hi>Lying,</hi> have ſinned againſt the Light of <hi>Anania</hi>'s, and <hi>Sapphira</hi>'s Example; who telling Lies,<note n="*" place="margin">Act. 5.4, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </note> were immediately ſtruck <hi>dead</hi> with them in their Mouths. As many as have been guilty of <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municating unworthily,</hi> have ſinned againſt the Light of the <hi>Corinthian</hi>'s Example.<note n="†" place="margin">1 Cor. 11.30.</note> Many of whom were weak and ſickly, and many ſlept, or died, for their raſh Prophanation, or irreve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Uſage of that ſacred Ordinance.</p>
               <p>Now when Providence hath dealt thus ſevere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with Sinners, with Sinners of all Sorts; and hath kindly recorded theſe its Diſpenſations, to keep them alive in our Memories, and exhibit them unto us: for <hi>us</hi> then inſtead of fearing their Puniſhments, to follow their Impieties; muſt be a tremendous <hi>Aggravation</hi> of our ſinful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. When GOD hath hang'd up ſome Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſours in Chains, as it were, to make us dread thoſe immoral Doings, which brought them to ſuch deplorable Ends; if we will not be reform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but go on, and live, and dye, in ſuch Sins: this will be ſuch an inhancement of our Guilt, as I can only recommend to your ſober <hi>Thoughts,</hi> and deſire you well and throughly
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:34484:154"/> to <hi>conſider;</hi> for indeed I cannot duly <hi>expreſs</hi> it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Seventhly,</hi> We have ſinned againſt <hi>the Light of</hi> Admonitions. The <hi>private</hi> Admonitions of ſuch, as either out of juſt Authority over us, or elſe out of Chriſtian Compaſſion to us, have occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionally beſtowed their pious and wholſom <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel</hi> upon us. It was an excellent Rule laid down by <hi>Moſes,</hi> and ought to be practis'd by CHRIST's beſt Diſciples: <hi>Thou ſhalt in any wiſe rebuke thy Neighbour, and not ſuffer ſin upon him, Levit.</hi> 19.17. Now if none have done this good Office to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards us, if none have been ſo much our Friends, as plainly to reprove us for our ſinful Exorbitancies; yet ſurely ſome have adviſed and admoniſht us. <hi>Parents,</hi> I hope, have not been ſo unnatural to us, nor <hi>God-fathers</hi> and <hi>God-mothers</hi> ſo regardleſs of us, nor <hi>Relatives</hi> and <hi>Friends</hi> ſo inconcerned for us, nor <hi>Miniſters</hi> ſo forgetful of their care over us; but at times they have given us ſerious Inſtructions, and reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Directions, and have earneſtly and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectionately intreated, and importun'd us, to li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſten to them, and be led by them. But were we ſo wiſe? Alas, how many inſtead of that have not minded, or have not mattered what hath been ſaid to us? but have at once deſpiſed the Counſel that was given us, and the Perſons who gave it. And is not this another amazing <hi>Aggravation</hi> of our ſinfulneſs? Unleſs we repent, we ſhall find it ſo at laſt. For look how <hi>many</hi> have been faithful <hi>Monitors,</hi> cautioning us againſt Sin; and ſo many <hi>Witneſſes</hi> there will be againſt us in the final Judicature, to caſt us in our Trial, and condemn us to Torment. And will not that be a moſt aſtoniſhing <hi>Light,</hi> that ſhall only
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:34484:155"/> ſhow <hi>Evidence,</hi> in the high Court of Juſtice, to cut us off, and conſign us to eternal Venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Laſtly,</hi> We have ſinned againſt <hi>the Light of</hi> humane Laws. And here I ſhall concern my ſelf no farther, than to ſhew that we have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly, and preſumptuouſly broken ſeveral <hi>Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute-laws</hi> under which we live. In many Caſes they lay their illightning Obligations upon us; but we have rudely violated them, by conſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>to</hi> and acting <hi>of</hi> ſuch groſs Immoralities as they expreſsly forbid, and put under juſt Penal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. Such hath been the laudable Piety of our Legiſlators, that they have taken due care to keep us innocent and virtuous, by reſtraining us from vitious and enormous Practices; or at leaſt by endeavouring their beſt to do it. To this end they have wiſely enacted, that if ſuch and ſuch Crimes were wilfully committed; the Perpetrators of them, ſhould be ſo and ſo puniſht. But <hi>we,</hi> too like the unjuſt Judge (who neither feared GOD, nor regarded Man) in many in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of affected unrighteouſneſs, have boldly ſinned againſt <hi>humane Ordinances,</hi> as well as <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus, as many of us, as have been guilty of prophane and cuſtomary <hi>Swearing</hi> and <hi>Curſing</hi> (which I fear, is little leſs than epidemical a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt us) have ſinned againſt the Light of a Law<note n="*" place="margin">16.

                     </gap>.</note> afterwards <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inforced,</hi> and the Penalties <hi>inlarged.</hi> The Light of which Law methinks is very bright in our Horizon. As many as have <hi>ſuborned</hi> others to <hi>forſwear</hi> themſelves, or have been <hi>guilty</hi> of <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury</hi> in their own Perſons; have ſinned againſt
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:34484:155"/> the Light of a Law made<note n="*" place="margin">29 Eliz.</note> perpetual for the <hi>puniſhment</hi> of ſuch Perſons, as ſhall either <hi>procure,</hi> or wilfully <hi>commit</hi> that horrid Wickedneſs. And does not this Light ſhine full in our Eyes? As many as have been guilty of <hi>Drunkenneſs,</hi> have ſinned againſt the Light of a Law made<note n="†" place="margin">4. Ja. 1.</note> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual for the <hi>repreſſing</hi> that ſin. And by the Light of that Law one would think, we ſhould ſee ſo much Vileneſs in it, as to hate and leave it. For it declares it to be<note n="‖" place="margin">
                     <hi>See</hi> Pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton.</note> a loathſom and odious Sin, and the root and foundation of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other enormous Sins. That beſides impover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhing many, by abuſively waſting the good Creatures of GOD; it occaſions Bloudſhed, Stabbing, Murder, Swearing, Fornication, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dultery, and ſuch like. Laſtly, As many as have been guilty of <hi>Prophaning</hi> the LORD's <hi>Day,</hi> have ſinned againſt the Light of a Law<note n="*" place="margin">29 Car. 2.</note> made for the better <hi>Obſervation</hi> of it. And this Light in conjunction with that of an higher Nature, which we happily injoy, ſhould have guided us directly to our Duties in the caſe: and where it hath not, our ſelves muſt needs be egregiouſly to blame.</p>
               <p>Now when the Providence of GOD, and the Wiſdom and Piety of good and great Men, have provided ſuch excellent <hi>Laws</hi> as theſe, to keep us from the aforeſaid, and ſuch like <hi>Impie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties;</hi> if we notwithſtanding have committed and repeated them; this of neceſſity muſt heigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten our Guilt, and proportionably inflame GOD's Wrath againſt us.</p>
               <p>Indeed when the Sins of a People grow rife and rampant, and their Tranſgreſſions ſpread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and notorious; if then <hi>good Laws</hi> be made to cruſh them, this vindicates the <hi>Government,</hi>
                  <pb n="268" facs="tcp:34484:156"/> and hinders thoſe Sins in a great Meaſure from becoming <hi>National;</hi> becauſe the <hi>Head</hi> of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or the <hi>Ruling Legiſlative part</hi> thereof, not only diſowns them, but appears againſt them, and labours to ſuppreſs them. But then the ſame Laws, which make theſe Sins unimputable to Governours as ſuch, and ſo renders them <hi>leſs</hi> national: do mightily aggravate them on the <hi>People</hi>'s ſide, as being committed againſt <hi>Laws</hi> deſigned to prevent them. So far then, as we know this to have been <hi>our</hi> Caſe, or perceive it to be the Caſe of the <hi>Nation</hi> that we live in, let us well weigh, and rightly conſider it; and in reaſon it muſt be as ſtrong a <hi>ſuaſive</hi> to <hi>Mourning,</hi> as it really is a ſad <hi>Aggravation</hi> of our Sins. And therefore, I have thus repreſented it here, ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>how</hi> to conſider it, (and by ſome Hints gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven) how, in our <hi>Thoughts</hi> to <hi>expatiate</hi> upon it, ſo as it may help to raiſe <hi>ſorrow</hi> in us, both for our <hi>own,</hi> and the <hi>Nations</hi> Impieties.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>The <hi>ſecond Aggravation</hi> of <hi>our own</hi> and <hi>others</hi> Sins, conſidered as the <hi>ſecond Sua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive</hi> to Mourning for <hi>the ſame: we have ſinned againſt the greateſt LOVE.</hi> As againſt <hi>the LOVE of GOD;</hi> and againſt <hi>the Love of our beſt Friends.</hi>
                  </p>
               </argument>
               <p>THE <hi>ſecond Aggravation</hi> of our ſinfulneſs, which is exceeding hainous (and O that it might be but as affecting) is, that we have ſinned <hi>againſt the Greateſt Love.</hi> This will eaſily be made appear; for we have ſinned againſt GOD, and He is <hi>Love,</hi> and <hi>infinite</hi> Love, and ſo the <hi>greateſt</hi> that can be. GOD is LOVE, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 4.8. An over-flowing Fountain of ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Kindneſs; or rather an immenſe and bound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Ocean of Clemency and Benevolence unto Men. And as His <hi>Diſpoſition</hi> to us is, ſuch alſo are His <hi>Dealings</hi> with us; unleſs our unworthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs provokes and forces Him to make them otherwiſe.</p>
               <p>Beſides illuſtrious <hi>Revelations</hi> in many Periods of His Word, He hath given us ſuch glorious <hi>Tokens</hi> of it, as ſtrongly argue, and plainly evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence that He is not only Love in <hi>Himſelf,</hi> but ſtrangely expreſſive of His Love to <hi>us.</hi> Some happy Creatures there are in the World, that know this is true, as finding it to be ſo by bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed <hi>Experience:</hi> I mean by their free Intercourſe, humble Familiarity, and holy Intimacy, with the ALMIGHTY. And they that do not feel
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:34484:157"/> it from <hi>ſenſible</hi> Influences, and Communications of His Favour; may yet be ſufficiently convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced of it by many <hi>Arguments.</hi> I alledge but <hi>one,</hi> which indeed may ſerve inſtead of all, as carrying the cleareſt Demonſtration with it: and that is, in ſhort, His <hi>Redeeming Mankind by the Death of His</hi> SON.</p>
               <p>St. <hi>John</hi> the Evangeliſt (of all the Apoſtles that writ) treats <hi>moſt</hi> of the <hi>Divine Love,</hi> as being (perhaps) beſt <hi>acquainted</hi> with it. And this <hi>Work</hi> of our <hi>Redemption,</hi> he makes a great <hi>Proof</hi> of the <hi>Tranſcendency</hi> of that Love, as it is a mighty <hi>Product</hi> of it. GOD <hi>ſo loved the World, that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoſoever believeth on Him, ſhould not periſh, but have everlaſting Life, Joh.</hi> 3.16. Where, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>ſo,</hi> is made uſe of only to amplify, or ſet off GOD's Love to the World of Men, in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king His SON the Price of our Redemption. Here was Love indeed; ſuch as was never heard of; ſuch as we may juſtly ſtand and wonder at even all our Life long, crying out with the mentioned inſpired Writer,<note n="*" place="margin">1 Joh 3.1.</note> 
                  <hi>Behold, what man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Love the Father hath beſtowed on us!</hi> But what do I ſpeak of wondring at this Love while we <hi>live?</hi> When we are dead and gone, and got to Heaven, <hi>Eternity</hi> it ſelf will be little enough for us to admire, and adore it in. 'Tis ſuch a Love as can no where be parallell'd. An Heighth that cannot be reached, a Depth that cannot be fathom'd, a Breadth that cannot be meaſured, a Vaſtneſs that cannot be comprehended.</p>
               <p>When Man by falling into Sin, was ſunk in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Death, and a ſtate of Perdition; if GOD had entertained but ſome <hi>Thoughts</hi> of His Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption, <hi>that</hi> would have been a piece of kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:34484:157"/> to us: but He <hi>reſolv'd</hi> and <hi>decreed</hi> to have it effected. When with full Reſolution and Purpoſe of finiſhing it, He ſet about it; He might have ſhown great Love in bringing it to paſs by a <hi>meaner Inſtrument;</hi> as by an Angel, or Arch-angel, a Cherubin or Seraphin, or a more inferior Creature: but He laid the heavy Burthen upon the Shoulders of His SON. When He impoſed this Task on His begotten SON, He might have authorized Him to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form it in a more <hi>honourable</hi> way; by ſitting in Heaven ſuppoſe and diſpatching it there, by the word of His mouth, or by the force of His power; (as ſome conceive He might:) but this was not allow'd: He muſt do it by <hi>Humiliation</hi> of Himſelf. When GOD had humbled Him for our ſakes, and from the higheſt Heavens had ſent Him down to this deſpicable Earth; He might have ſet him in a more ſuitable <hi>Station</hi> or <hi>Degree.</hi> Conſidering his Dignity, he might have made him a puiſſant Emperour, or a mighty King, or ſome illuſtrious Prince, or Potentate: but <hi>this</hi> might not be neither. He was fain to ſtoop to <hi>loweſt</hi> circumſtances. He had a poor <hi>Jewiſh Maid</hi> to His Mother, and an ordinary <hi>Mecha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nick</hi> for His reputed Father, and as ſome think, was by him brought up to the Carpenters Trade: and ſo (according to the <hi>Letter</hi> of that piece of His Character) he plainly appear'd in the <hi>Form of a Servant.</hi> And anſwerable to this, was His worldly condition; His Eſtate as low, as His Perſon ſeem'd little. For <hi>he had</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">Mat. 8.20.</note> 
                  <hi>not where to lay his head.</hi> And when a Tribute was to be paid for <hi>Him</hi> and His Diſciples, He was forc'd by a Miracle, to fetch up the Money from the
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:34484:158"/> bottom of the Sea, before He could diſcharge it. When GOD had rankt Him thus <hi>low</hi> in the World, and made Him, in appearance, ſo very inconſiderable; He might have pleas'd that this marvellous <hi>humiliation</hi> of Him, ſhould have done the work without farther trouble: but neither could <hi>that</hi> be eſteem'd ſufficient. It was not enough for Him to be <hi>mean,</hi> unleſs withal he was <hi>miſerable.</hi> Pains muſt be ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>added to His ſtrange Poverty; and He muſt want eaſe, as much as He did Plenty. When GOD had pitch'd upon JESUS's <hi>Sufferings</hi> as the <hi>propereſt</hi> means of our Redemption, He might have favoured Him <hi>here</hi> yet; For He might have accepted of ſome <hi>ordinary</hi> ſufferings, and have been ſatisfy'd with gentle and mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate <hi>Inflictions:</hi> but <hi>theſe</hi> would not ſerve the turn. And therefore He was not to endure <hi>Pain</hi> only, but <hi>Death</hi> it ſelf, and ſo be made a <hi>Sacrifice</hi> and <hi>Propitiation</hi> for us. When GOD determin'd that His SON ſhould <hi>Die,</hi> as know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Death to be neceſſary to our Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; yet then He might have appointed Him a <hi>fair</hi> and <hi>eaſie</hi> Death: but <hi>this</hi> likewiſe was too much to be granted. And therefore, as we know, He died on the <hi>Croſs,</hi> the very <hi>worſt</hi> Death in ſeveral reſpects, which He could poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly undergo. Yet Crucify'd He was, and that betwixt <hi>two Thieves,</hi> as if He had been the leudeſt Malefactor of the Three.</p>
               <p>Put all this together, and ſay if it will not make up a <hi>peerleſs love.</hi> Eſpecially if we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the <hi>objects</hi> of it, and that <hi>we</hi> were they to whom it was expreſſed. And pray <hi>what</hi> are <hi>we? Naturally,</hi> but <hi>men,</hi> and ſo Duſt and Aſhes. <hi>Morally, Sinners,</hi> and ſo the worſt of humane
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:34484:158"/> Creatures. Far worſe than I can ſpeak, or any can imagin. Yet when we were thus mean, and thus extremely bad, ye ſee what GOD was pleas'd to do for us. He ſeriouſly <hi>thought</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on our Redemption. He did not only <hi>think</hi> of it, but <hi>reſolv'd</hi> to accompliſh it. He did not only <hi>reſolve</hi> to do it, but <hi>appointed</hi> it to be done. He <hi>appointed</hi> it to be done, not by a <hi>mean Inſtrument,</hi> but by his SON. Not by his SON <hi>ſitting in Heaven,</hi> but <hi>humbled</hi> to the Earth. Not by his <hi>Humiliation</hi> into <hi>Poverty</hi> only, but into <hi>painful Sufferings,</hi> ſuch as terminated in <hi>Death.</hi> Nor was it a <hi>common</hi> Death, which He ſuffered, but the Death of the <hi>Croſs.</hi> And as a ſad <hi>Addition</hi> to all his miſery, or rather as the utmoſt <hi>complement</hi> of it; He loſt the ſenſe of GOD's favour, and lay under the <hi>Preſſure</hi> of all that trouble which the want of <hi>communion</hi> with his Heavenly FATHER, could afflict him with. And was not this a moſt <hi>Superlative Love?</hi> Could we have <hi>deſired</hi> ſo <hi>much</hi> of GOD? Could GOD ever have done <hi>more</hi> for <hi>us?</hi> What would we have the ALMIGHTY do? Would we have Him ſeemingly <hi>undeifie</hi> himſelf, as it were, by becoming a <hi>man</hi> like one of us? So he did. Would we have Him become the <hi>ſorrieſt</hi> and moſt <hi>contemptible</hi> of Men? So He did. For as the Prophet ſays,<note n="*" place="margin">Iſa. 53.3.</note> 
                  <hi>He was deſpiſed, rejected and not eſteemed.</hi> Would we have Him become a <hi>Sinner?</hi> Be it ſpoken with Reverence, and to His Honour, he made Himſelf ſin upon our ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, which was very near it. For He took upon Him the ſins of the whole World, and ſo was the <hi>greateſt</hi> ſinner, in it by imputation. O mighty Love! O matchleſs Love! too big to be conceived, and conſequently not poſſible to
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:34484:159"/> be fully expreſſed; and therefore let us ſay no more concerning it. Only GOD having dealt thus lovingly with us, we may aſſuredly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that not any thing he can do, ſhall be wanting to our Happineſs. And in caſe he does not advance us to it by <hi>irreſiſtible power,</hi> and a force invincible (as ſome are ready to ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue he may) 'tis meerly becauſe he <hi>cannot</hi> do it, as<note n="*" place="margin">Vid. <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſcop.</hi> in 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 4.8.</note> ſome think. Even becauſe 'tis inconſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtent with His Bleſſed Law, the Reſult of his infinite Goodneſs and Wiſdom; and becauſe 'tis unagreeable to our own Nature; and ſo implies repugnancy, and ruin to both.</p>
               <p>But now that which intollerably <hi>aggravates</hi> our Guilt, is that we have ſinned againſt this <hi>Wondrous Love.</hi> All its Flames have not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſum'd our Droſs; all its heat hath not melted us into Obedience to that gracious GOD, who loved us ſo exceedingly. Nay, we have wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly made this Love of His, an occaſion of <hi>ſinning</hi> againſt His MAJESTY; and have done amiſs with more freedom and frequency, becauſe His Love abounded towards us.</p>
               <p>Our Surety was able to pay our Debts, and therefore we cared not how far we ran on in the Score. We valu'd not ſtabbing our preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Souls becauſe we had a Sovereign Medicine at hand, to heal the Wounds. We have made CHRIST's Death a Patent for Licentiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and have been the more ready to offend GOD, becauſe he gave his SON to die for our Offences. The <hi>biggeſt Aggravation</hi> of Baſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs that can be. It lifts up our Guilt above that of <hi>Devils;</hi> the worſt of which never re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belled againſt <hi>Redeeming</hi> Love, nor committed one ſin againſt a crucify'd LORD, who laid
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:34484:159"/> down his Life for their Salvation. A moſt ſad conſideration; and did we but keep our Minds cloſe to it, and dwell upon it in ſerious and compos'd Reflections; methinks we ſhould need no better <hi>ſuaſive</hi> to <hi>Mourning</hi> for our <hi>own,</hi> and the <hi>Nation</hi>'s Sins.</p>
               <p>Yet here, we may advance a little farther (<hi>ſome</hi> of us at leaſt) and fitly think that we have ſinned againſt the <hi>Love</hi> of our <hi>beſt Friends.</hi> Our trueſt Friends are moſt concern'd for our greateſt Intereſts. They look chiefly at the Diſpoſitions and habits of our Minds, and are anxious and ſolicitous for the welfare of our Souls. With a watchful eye, and a yearning heart, they mark and obſerve us in our <hi>Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al</hi> relations and capacities: how we carry our ſelves towards GOD; how we are affected with Religion; how we are furniſht with Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Perfections; how well prepared we are to die, and how well provided to live for ever. And if they find us defective in theſe Accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhments, it becomes an occaſion of <hi>ſadneſs</hi> to them, and ſinks them down into <hi>Grief</hi> and <hi>Miſery.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A famous inſtance and pattern of this, was the rarely virtuous and renowned <hi>Monica,</hi> Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of St. <hi>Auguſtine.</hi> When he was young and vain, and looſe in his Manners; this pious Matron laid his Extravagancies deeply to heart, and night and day, lamented his wild and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orbitant life.</p>
               <p>And this may be the caſe of our Real Friends, and at ſuch a rate they may be affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted for ſome of us. They may pine at our Wickedneſs, and pray for our Repentance, and
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:34484:160"/> ſigh and ſorrow to behold our ſtubborneſs and ſtrange Perverſeneſs. While we with delight and brutiſh complacence, diſhonour GOD, and deſtroy our ſelves; they may be almoſt overwhelm'd with ſadneſs, at the ſight of our Prophaneſs, and the ſenſe of our Debauchery. Let us think upon this, and learn to <hi>mourn</hi> for our <hi>own</hi> Sins, that have been ſo offenſive to our choiceſt Friends. <hi>They</hi> could no way ſhew tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, never ſhew greater kindneſs to us. But then the ſingular Cordial <hi>Affection</hi> on their ſide, grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouſly <hi>aggravates</hi> the <hi>ſins</hi> on ours; and that ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravation ſhould ſtill <hi>raiſe</hi> our <hi>ſorrow,</hi> and <hi>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe</hi> holy <hi>Mourning.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If thou that readeſt this, knoweſt it thy caſe; if thou knoweſt that thy ſins afflict thy beſt Friends: I have this <hi>Caveat</hi> to leave with thee. <hi>Take heed of abuſing their affectionate Tenderneſs.</hi> There's too much ill <hi>Principle</hi> in thy Proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings already, do not ſuperadd ill <hi>nature</hi> to it. If ſin hath eat out all ſenſe of Religion, yet ſurely thou haſt ſomewhat of <hi>humanity</hi> left; ſomething of common <hi>civility</hi> in thee; eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally to kindeſt Friends and Relatives. Ceaſe to ſin then in reſpect to <hi>them,</hi> who manifeſt ſuch pious compaſſion to thee; leſt thou ſhortneſt their Lives, and ſendeſt them ſorrowing to their Graves.</p>
               <p>O it is a rich and invaluable mercy to diſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute Perſons, that they have ſuch Friends as theſe I ſpeak of. Friends that can <hi>weep</hi> over their provoking miſcarriages, and with plenty of powerful Tears and Prayers, <hi>intercede</hi> to the Merciful GOD for them. But let none of
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:34484:160"/> theſe ſinners be ſo unkind, and ingrateful, and unhappy too, as by obſtinate perſiſtence in a courſe of unrighteouſneſs, to break the hearts of theſe incomparable Friends, and ſo deprive themſelves of an ineſtimable Bleſſing.</p>

               </argument>
               <p>NOW follows the <hi>laſt Aggravation</hi> of our ſinfulneſs; which as it is very heinous, ſhould be as affecting to us: <hi>We have ſinned in a</hi> moſt ſhameful manner. <hi>Light</hi> could not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troll, nor could <hi>Love</hi> reſtrain us; we ſinned under and againſt them <hi>both.</hi> But which adds to our Guilt, and renders it much more grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous ſtill, we have ſinned withal, moſt <hi>hide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly,</hi> or <hi>ſhamefully.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This will appear, if we will conſider theſe <hi>Four</hi> things: <list>
                     <item>1. The nature and malignity of our Sins.</item>
                     <item>2. The multiplicity, or variety of them.</item>
                     <item>3. The repetition, or frequency of them.</item>
                     <item>4. Our boldneſs, or impudence in Sinning.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> Our Sins are of an <hi>high Nature,</hi> or <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignity.</hi> As if Sins of a <hi>lower</hi> Quality, or leſſer Rate, would not throw us faſt, or far enough out of GOD's Favour; or ſink us down deep enough into His Diſpleaſure: we have been forward to thoſe of a <hi>worſer ſort</hi> and of a <hi>larger ſize.</hi> Sinful <hi>Thoughts,</hi> and ſinful <hi>Words,</hi> would not content us; we have broken out in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſinful <hi>Actions:</hi> and in <hi>actual</hi> ſins we have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded.
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:34484:161"/> For ſins of incogitancy or inadverten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy would not ſerve us; we have run into ſins of Deliberation. Sins of omiſſion, or neglect, would not ſatisfie us; we have plunged into ſins of commiſſion. Sins of infirmity, or weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, could not bound us; we have ruſhed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſins of Preſumption. And all theſe <hi>high Acts</hi> of ſin have not been of the leaſt <hi>kinds</hi> of Sins neither. For if we look narrowly into our <hi>Tranſgreſſions,</hi> perhaps we ſhall find them of a fouler nature, of a blacker ſtain, and of a deeper Die, than we are aware. Yea, think what ſins are moſt <hi>odious</hi> to GOD, and <hi>flagiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous</hi> in themſelves, and theſe I fear, will appear to have been <hi>ours,</hi> in too great meaſure, if we throughly examine our Spiritual ſtate.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> Our Sins are <hi>multiform and various.</hi> They are not all of <hi>one ſort,</hi> but of <hi>ſeveral kinds.</hi> According to the Character of the Impious, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 69.27. we have <hi>fallen from one wickedneſs to another:</hi> or have added iniquity to iniquity. To Sins againſt GOD, we added Sins againſt our <hi>Neighbours;</hi> and to Sins againſt <hi>them,</hi> Sins againſt <hi>our ſelves;</hi> if we diſtinguiſh them accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the <hi>Object.</hi> And if diverſified according to other circumſtances, as <hi>Time,</hi> and <hi>Place,</hi> and <hi>Providence,</hi> &amp;c. we have ſinned in our Youth, and in our riper years; ſecretly, and openly; by our ſelves, and with others. Againſt Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, and againſt Judgments, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But leſt in diverſifying ſin, I ſhould here run out into too large a Series of Particulars; inſtead of going farther, I refer the Reader to thoſe <hi>brief</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">See them under the Title <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Devotions.</hi> And moſt fitly may we peruſe and conſi or them well, on our <hi>Mourning</hi> Days.</note> 
                  <hi>Heads of Self-examination,</hi> contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:34484:162"/> in that excellent Book <hi>the whole Duty of Man.</hi> Where we ſhall find Sin ſo fully, though compendiouſly repreſented in the ſundry <hi>Kinds,</hi> and <hi>Branches</hi> of it, as will very much help us to underſtand the great <hi>variety</hi> of our Sins.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Our Sins have been <hi>frequent and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated.</hi> As we have committed <hi>many</hi> Sins, ſo we have acted them <hi>many times.</hi> As if ſome had been born for nothing but to Sin, they have indeed done little elſe. And they that have been more moderately vicious, or the moſt ſtrict and virtuous livers of all; have run into ſo many reiterations of Sin, that they are without Number. Witneſs the Pſalmiſt's ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn Interrogatory,<note n="*" place="margin">Pſal. 19.12.</note> 
                  <hi>Who can underſtand his errors?</hi> That is, how <hi>frequently</hi> he hath repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed or renewed them. And therefore in our <hi>other</hi> Tranſlation it runs thus; <hi>Who can tell how oft he offendeth?</hi> According to which, to count up our Sins, will puzzle the beſt Arithmetici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans amongſt us. Who can reckon up their evil <hi>thoughts?</hi> And yet the Sins of the <hi>Tongue</hi> can no more be numbred than thoſe of the <hi>Mind.</hi> And therefore <hi>truly</hi> to ſumm up all our Sins, muſt needs be impoſſible. Even as im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible as to compute the Drops of Water that are in the Sea; or the Grains of Sand that lie ſpread upon the biggeſt Deſart of the Earth. A moſt ſad Thought if ſeriouſly entertain'd by pious Men.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Laſtly,</hi> We have ſinned <hi>boldly and impudently.</hi> Many of us want common <hi>Modeſty,</hi> as well as Chriſtian Integrity: and therefore we<note n="*" place="margin">Iſa. 3.9.</note> 
                  <hi>declare our ſins as Sodom, and hide them not.</hi> Some a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt us have not only been fooliſh and bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh before GOD; but alſo before <hi>men,</hi> and in
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:34484:162"/> the ſight of the Sun. They have wallowed <hi>publickly</hi> in their leudneſs, and have owned their Prophaneſs; and have been ſo far from ſneak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into corners to cover their Baſeneſs, that they have practis'd it abroad in the open Streets. And when they have done, inſtead of being abaſhed at their monſtrous ſin, they have rather been proud of it, and have gloried in that which was their greateſt ſhame. And to this very day, how uſual is it every where, for naughty Men to glory thus ſhamefully? To boaſt of their ſtrength in Drinking; to vaunt of their malice in Revenging; to make ſport with Atheiſtical Talking; to divert themſelves, and others like them, with nauſeous Stories of their Swearing, lying, defrauding, debauching and the like. And ſo beſides affronting and diſhonouring GOD, by breaking his Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and Holy Laws; they mock and laugh at the violation of them. As if they meant to put <hi>Shamefacedneſs</hi> quite out of countenance; and to ſcorn, and deride, and hector all <hi>Baſhfulneſs</hi> out of the World. This may be thought very <hi>plain,</hi> and I own it to be ſo; but then withal it is very <hi>true,</hi> and that makes it as <hi>ſad.</hi> O that I had no occaſion to ſpeak thus!</p>
               <p>And though all of us have not the ſame <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees</hi> of <hi>Impudence</hi> to anſwer for; yet ſinning too impudently, or audaciouſly, may well be charged on us; becauſe (as hath been ſaid) we have ſinned highly, and ſinned variouſly, and ſinned frequently. A moſt lamentable conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, if throughly weighed. Enough to melt any Heart, that is not as hard as the nether Milſtone.</p>
               <pb n="282" facs="tcp:34484:163"/>
               <p>Now what remains, but that in the Name of GOD, I beſeech all thoſe who read this Book, deſigned to promote <hi>Religious Mourning;</hi> that they would duly <hi>conſider</hi> theſe <hi>Suaſives</hi> to it; and add any elſe, which they ſhall think, or find, to be proper and uſeful. So I doubt not, but what I aim at, in this plain Treatiſe, will (with Heaven's Bleſſing) be happily ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſht. I mean, our Souls ſhall weep in ſecret, and our Hearts ſhall mourn within us, for our <hi>own,</hi> and <hi>others</hi> Sins; eſpecially thoſe of <hi>this Nation.</hi>

               <p>Help me, LORD JESUS, to ſow in Tears, that I may reap in Joy; and ſo to mourn, as that I may be comforted.</p>

               <p>Oh my Sins, my Sins, my many, and my grievous Sins: LORD, what have I done? O LORD, what ſhall I do?</p>
               <p>When thou haſt done weeping, pray:</p>
               <q>Deareſt REDEEMER, accept the Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of a troubled Spirit; and waſh my Tears with Thy moſt precious and purifying Bloud.</q>

If therefore you have mourned in ſuch a meaſure, as to be ſomewhat infee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled at preſent, and to abate in the vigour, or pious fervency of your Applications to Heaven; then to refreſh you a little by change of Exerciſe, riſe up here, and read the 9th Chapter of <hi>Ezekiel.</hi> There you ſhall find holy <hi>Mourning</hi> for <hi>others ſins,</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged. Or elſe read the 9th of <hi>Daniel,</hi> to the 22th Verſe; where a famous Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet invites to it by his great Example. So by relaxing your Mind a while, you will
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:34484:166"/> recruit your impaired Strength, and be the better inabled to mourn afreſh. But if you feel your Zeal ſtill upon the Wing, and not too much weak'ned by expenſive Grief; then continue the Imployment which you were in, and without ſtopping, go on thus.</p>

               <p>LORD, make mine Eyes a Fountain of Tears, to weep for the Tranſgreſſions of this ſinful Nation.</p>
               <p>Let mine<note n="†" place="margin">Lam. 1.16, 20.</note> Eye run down with Water, O GOD, and let my Bowels be troubled, becauſe this People have ſo grievouſly rebelled.</p>
               <p>We have<note n="‖" place="margin">Pſ. 106.6.</note> ſinned with our Fathers, we have committed iniquity, we have done wickedly: for this let mine<note n="*" place="margin">Lam. 2.11, 19.</note> Eyes flow with Tears, and
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:34484:169"/> let me pour out my heart like Water, before the face of Thee, O LORD.</p>
               <p>I have contributed too much to the Sins of this Land, which call for Vengeance; inable me, Good GOD, to help to drown that hide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Cry with holy Mourning.</p>
               <p>If Sorrow ſwells to ſuch a rate, as to debilitate or diſpirit you; then once more ſhift your Poſture and Imployment, in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of your fainting, tiring Zeal. For tho' the Spirit in it ſelf be ſtrong, and ſo very willing and forward to perſiſt; yet being clogg'd and loaden with the burthen of this fleſh, it may very well want Support and Reſpite. Here therefore, riſing up from your humble Proſtration, read a Chapter or two of the <hi>Lamentations,</hi> or of ſome other Book in the <hi>Bible.</hi> Unleſs you had rather make uſe of any <hi>practical Piece</hi> of ſome pious Author by you.

               <p>FOR there the Agency is direct, without the dull Help, or Mediation of Organs; and wherever the Soul is toucht <hi>immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately,</hi> ſhe muſt be mov'd more <hi>forcibly.</hi> And this may probably give much ſtrength to <hi>Temptations.</hi> I mean to <hi>Satanical</hi> ones, or ſuch as the <hi>Devil</hi> aſſaults us with. For He being a <hi>Spirit,</hi> for that Reaſon, tho' his actings upon us be ſecret and inviſible, yet they may be exceeding ſtrong and powerful. For <hi>ſpiritual</hi> Beings are capable of nearer mutual Unions, than <hi>material</hi> ones. Becauſe things corporeal touch but ſuperficially, and join only in their outſides: whereas <hi>Penetrability</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Property of Spirits, they can eaſily per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vade, or run through one another, mingling their very Subſtances together. And thus, 'tis like the Tempter deals with us. He may not only make uſe of our Blood, and our Spirits, and the Humors of our Bodies, to imprint and faſten his Temptations upon us; but moreover
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:34484:183"/> may inſinuate himſelf to our very Souls, and ſo by moſt inward preſential Applications, ſtrongly incline us to that which is evil. Thus we ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times find by uneaſy Experience, that our Minds are held cloſe to ſinful Objects even againſt our Wills; and when we would fain break looſe, and turn our Fancies another way, they are kept intent (even by reluctant Animadverſion) upon Motives to Naughtineſs. Now what could thus far force our Minds, and keep them fixt in ſuch unvoluntary poſtures or diſpoſitions, but the great Enemy of our Souls? And how can we conceive he ſhould do it ſo well, as by his own ſtriking through them by unperceiv'd Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netration? For ſo he may impregnate his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious Motions with the fierceſt vigour, and raiſe them to the higheſt degrees of Strength, by conveying himſelf into us together with them. Yea, ſome Temptations are ſo extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant and unreaſonable, ſo baſe and malicious, and ſo much againſt Religion, and the Chriſtian Temper; (as thoſe to <hi>atheiſtical</hi> and <hi>blaſphemous Thoughts,</hi> and the like) that methinks they could never break in upon us, if Satan himſelf were not there already to help them to enter: nor could they ever continue ſo long with us, nor preſs ſo mightily as they do upon our Souls, if he were not intimately joined to us to maintain and uphold them in ſo high a force. But then ſince he can tempt us ſo powerfully, by virtue of his Spirituality, which qualifies him for near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt acceſſes to us, and conjunctions with us; we ſhould be ſo wiſe, as to keep our ſelves always, by holy living, in GOD's favour and cuſtody; that ſo the utmoſt of our Adverſary's fury and violence, may never be able to prevail againſt us.</p>
               <pb n="323" facs="tcp:34484:183"/>
               <p>And as evil Spirits may tempt Men as above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid, by <hi>inſinuating</hi> into them, ſo according to the <hi>Number</hi> and <hi>Malice</hi> of thoſe Spirits in any looſe Perſons, will their <hi>Temptations</hi> and <hi>their</hi> Sins be. And therefore the HOLY GHOST ſpeaking of one whoſe<note n="*" place="margin">Mat. 12.45.</note> 
                  <hi>laſt State</hi> was to be <hi>worſe</hi> than his <hi>firſt;</hi> gives this account of the ſad <hi>Cauſe</hi> of that diſmal Effect, that <hi>ſeven De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils</hi> worſe than that which actuated him before Were gotten into him. And for the like reaſon, <hi>Mary Magdalen</hi> was ſo ſcandalouſly guilty of carnal impurities: even becauſe <hi>ſeven Devils</hi> (or <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>unclean Spirits,</hi> as the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel terms them) were in her, as Tempters to that ſort of Lewdneſs. For ſo many were caſt out of her, by the SON of GOD, S. <hi>Mark</hi> 16.9.</p>
               <p>Yet ſtill we muſt allow, that there is ſome difference betwixt the Perſons thus <hi>tempted</hi> by Devils, and thoſe that are down-right <hi>poſſeſſed</hi> of them. For in the <hi>firſt</hi> Caſe, evil Spirits ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply themſelves only to our <hi>Souls:</hi> and that with intention and endeavour to ſtimulate and urge them on to <hi>Sin.</hi> But in the <hi>latter</hi> Caſe, they ſeem to ſettle in the <hi>Body,</hi> and to take up their Reſidence in <hi>that,</hi> deſigning ſome way or other to be <hi>injurious</hi> to it. And the Injuries they do it of this Nature, are commonly very viſible or apparent; and are moſtly done one of theſe ways.</p>
               <p>Either by vitiating its Organs, and ſo hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring its Functions, or hurting its Faculties, or its Senſes. Thus we read of one that was <hi>dumb</hi> by the Devil's poſſeſſing him, <hi>Mat.</hi> 9.32. And of another that was <hi>deaf</hi> and <hi>dumb</hi> upon the ſame account, <hi>Mar.</hi> 9.25.</p>

               <p>IT is ſomewhat ſtrange, not to ſay wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful; that the ſolemn Threats denounc'd by one poor ſingle Perſon (a Forreiner whoſe Face they never ſaw before) in the Streets of <hi>Nini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veh</hi> (the Head of ſo vaſt an Empire) ſhould ſo terrify the King and People at once, as to ſet them all a mourning for their Sins. There muſt be ſome ſpecial reaſon for it; and it may be worth the while, to enquire and find it out if we can.</p>
               <p>Some may imagine that they had clear Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of that miraculous Providence which at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended <hi>Jonah.</hi> I mean, which preſerv'd him by that great Fiſh, which ſwallow'd him alive when he was thrown into the Sea, and then caſt him up ſafe again upon the Land. And if they knew he was charg'd to fore-tell their deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and that for fear of doing it he fled from the imployment; and yet after that was forc'd to undertake it, and was ſo wonderfully kept in order to it: this might convince them his Prediction was true, and their expectation of the ſad and direful Iſſue, might put them upon mourning for their Sins, to prevent it. But then how they ſhould come by this Intelligence, will be hard to make out. For tho' <hi>Jonah</hi> might tell them it, and vouch it to be true; yet the Story coming but from his own Mouth, would have wanted farther Confirmation. And truly ſo prodigious a Narrative from him, to make
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:34484:185"/> the <hi>Ninevites</hi> believe, that what he menaced ſhould come to paſs: would have rendred his Threatning the more doubtful, when it had none but the Relator's Authority to ſupport it.</p>
               <p>Had he been thrown over-board in the <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſian</hi> Sea, into which near <hi>Teredon,</hi> or <hi>Balſora,</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">So Sir <hi>W. Raleigh</hi> calls it. And it will bear that Name, as well as the Name of <hi>Euphrates;</hi> the Stream thereabout conſiſting of both thoſe Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</note> the <hi>Tigris</hi> or <hi>Euphrates</hi> diſembogues it ſelf; it might have been thought that the Whale, in whoſe Belly he was, might have carri'd him up that River, and have caſt him out ſomewhere near to <hi>Niniveh,</hi> which ſtood upon its Banks. And ſo the Miracle of the Prophet's Preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion might have been taken notice of by many dwelling in that Royal City. Thus <hi>Sulpitius Severus</hi> thought he was caſt up, ad Ninivitarum littora, <hi>on the Shoars of</hi> Niniveh. But this muſt be an extravagant Fancy. For then the Whale muſt have ſwam out of the <hi>Mediterranean,</hi> round about <hi>Africa,</hi> and beyond <hi>Arabia</hi> (a Courſe of ſome thouſands of Leagues) into the <hi>Perſian</hi> Gulf. And then ſhe muſt have gone up ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral hundreds of Miles againſt the ſtrong and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pid Current of the aforeſaid River, before ſhe could have thrown up <hi>Jonah</hi> on thoſe Banks where <hi>Niniveh</hi> was ſituate. But how could the Fiſh do this in ſo ſhort a time? Tho' could it have been done, I grant it might well have diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed the <hi>Ninevites,</hi> to hear and obey him. The Wonder of his Preſervation and Paſſage by Sea, would have been as authentic Credentials as could be wiſht; and none could have doubted his being GOD's Embaſſador, that conſidered his Commiſſion had ſuch a Seal. But the thing indeed being naturally impoſſible, that Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian's Opinion muſt needs be falſe, who does not record it as a Miracle.</p>
               <pb n="327" facs="tcp:34484:185"/>
               <p>Nor do I take <hi>Joſephus</hi>'s to be true. In the Ninth Book of his<note n="*" place="margin">Chap. 11.</note> Antiquities, he affirms (as he found it Regiſtred in <hi>Hebrew</hi> Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicles) that the great Fiſh which ſwallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Jonah,</hi> vomited him up on the ſhore of the <hi>Euxine</hi> Sea. But this, I ſay, ſeems not at all probable. For ſo the Fiſh muſt have ſwum ſix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen hundred Miles, in three Days and Nights, to have laid him upon that ſhore; which in an ordinary way (and we read of nothing extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary in the Caſe) the could not do in ſuch a ſpace of time. Eſpecially if thoſe three days and nights, are to be taken (by Synecdoche) for but part of three Days and Nights<note n="*" place="margin">Mercer. Druſius, &amp;c.</note>, as ſome think they are; and as that Text plainly inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates, <hi>Mat.</hi> 12.40. <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> alſo ſuggeſts ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther reaſon why this could not be. Becauſe then the Fiſh muſt have paſſed through the <hi>Propontis,</hi> or <hi>il Mare di Marmora.</hi> But that he af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms to be too ſtrait for any<note n="*" place="margin">Hiſt. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimal. li. 8. cap. 13.</note> of the greater Whales to penetrate. Tho' then the <hi>ſtraitneſs</hi> he means, muſt be in the <hi>Shallowneſs</hi> of its wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, not in the Breadth of them. For the <hi>Helle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpont</hi> on this ſide of the <hi>Propontis,</hi> and the <hi>Boſpho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi> beyond it; through which the Whale muſt have made her way into the <hi>Euxine</hi> Sea, are both much narrower than the <hi>Propontis</hi> is; and yet the <hi>Boſphorus,</hi> the narroweſt of the three, is wide enough for ſeveral of the biggeſt ſort of Whales, to ſwim through it a Breaſt.</p>
               <p>With likelihood therefore we may conjecture That <hi>Jonah</hi> ſailing from <hi>Joppa</hi> to <hi>Tarſus,</hi> and in his Voyage being thrown into the Midland-Sea; about the Bay of <hi>Iſſus</hi> or <hi>Liazzo</hi> on the Coaſts of <hi>Caramania,</hi> he might be vomited out upon the dry Land. And being there releaſed
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:34484:186"/> from his ſtrange Confinement, the ſtrangeſt that ever Mortal ſuffered; from thence he might travel along to <hi>Nineveh,</hi> upon his Divine and dreadful Embaſſy.</p>
               <p>And that in the <hi>Mediterranean</hi> there are Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhes able to ſwallow Men alive, we need not doubt. For there as well as in other Deep Seas, the <hi>Lamiae,</hi> or <hi>Dog-fiſhes</hi> have their haunt: ſo ravenous, and of ſuch a bigneſs, that they eaſily devour a whole Man at a mouthful. And therefore <hi>Rondeletius,</hi> who gives as good an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of Fiſhes, as any that ever wrote concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning them, tells us that the <hi>Lamia</hi> is <hi>Piſcis An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thropophagus,</hi> a Fiſh that eats Men. And that ſome of them taken at <hi>Marſeilles</hi> and <hi>Nizza,</hi> have had entire Men all in Armour found in their Bellies. Tho' other Fiſhes of much lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger Dimenſions, can by no means get down ſuch Morſels. Of this kind, for inſtance, are the <hi>Balaenae,</hi> or <hi>Whirlpool Fiſhes;</hi> vaſt Creatures, but utterly unable to ſwallow a whole Man, by reaſon of the ſtraitneſs of their Throat; it being as<note n="*" place="margin">Contr. Cardan. de Balaenis.</note> 
                  <hi>Scaliger</hi> affirms, not above <hi>Semipedem patens,</hi> half a foot wide.</p>
               <p>But then how <hi>Nineveh</hi> that Heathen City, ſhould come to give ſuch credit to <hi>Jonah,</hi> and to be ſo happily influenc'd by his threatning Preachments, is ſtill a Queſtion. But for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolving it, let us try if we cannot find ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing material hinted by the HOLY GHOST, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 14. For there perhaps we may find a Key of His making, which will help to unlock this Difficulty. In the latter part of that Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, we read that <hi>Jeroboam</hi> the King of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> recovered <hi>Damaſcus,</hi> and <hi>Hamath;</hi> and that he reſtored the Coaſt of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> from the entring of
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:34484:186"/> 
                  <hi>Hamath,</hi> unto the Sea of the Plain, according to the word of the LORD GOD of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> which he ſpake by the hand of His Servant <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nah</hi> the Son of <hi>Amittai.</hi> Now as <hi>Damaſcus</hi> was an ancient City, built before <hi>Abraham</hi>'s time, (for his Steward was called <hi>Eliezer</hi> of <hi>Damaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus;</hi>) and as it was a moſt pleaſant City, ſo delightful, that <hi>Mahomet</hi> never durſt enter into it, leſt it ſhould tempt him to neglect his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns: ſo it was a great and moſt powerful City, as being no leſs than the Metropolis of <hi>Syria.</hi> And ſuch a City as this, the Head of a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and the Royal Seat of a mighty Kingdom; being taken by the King of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> from the King of <hi>Syria:</hi> the King of <hi>Nineveh,</hi> the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fines of whoſe Empire were not remote from it, could not but take ſpecial notice of. And <hi>Jero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boam</hi> being animated to the War, which was thus ſucceſsful, by the word of the Prophet <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nah,</hi> who clearly foretold what the Iſſue would be; we need not queſtion but the King of <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neveh</hi> underſtood this too: there being nothing more uſual than for Kings and States (where their Dominions are contiguous, or no farther diſtant) to pry into the Intrigues and affairs of each other. But then he underſtanding that there was a Prophet in <hi>Paleſtine,</hi> who unerringly foretold contingent Events, and particularly the Fate of that flouriſhing City, which fell out ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his Prediction; when he heard that this very Prophet was come to <hi>Nineveh,</hi> on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to denounce Deſtruction againſt it, which according to his Threatning was to happen ſuddenly too, unleſs the Inhabitants of it repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: he might very well be concern'd as he was, and ſet himſelf and his People to <hi>mourn</hi> as
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:34484:187"/> he did. And the more readily might this be done yet, in caſe <hi>Jonah</hi> went to <hi>Nineveh</hi> with any Merchant Caravan Trading into the Eaſt from <hi>Tyrus,</hi> then the greateſt Empory in that part of the World. For <hi>Tyrians</hi> living upon that Sea where <hi>Jonah</hi> was thrown over-board, and ſo miraculouſly preſerved; and knowing it to be true: if any of them reported and affirmed it at <hi>Nineveh,</hi> this might help to beget a more firm belief ſtill of his dreadful Threatning.</p>

               <p>WE are not to imagine, that Heaven did any thing to reſtrain or hinder the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragious violences done to thoſe Martyrs. Their Eyes were really bor'd out, their Legs cut off, their Bones broken, their Fleſh beaten, bruiſed, mangled, burned, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Not are we to conceive, that when theſe Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lences were done to their Bodies; the Law or Order of communicating them to their Souls in way of Senſation, was interrupted or diſſolved. For when their Bodies ſuffered in any capacity, by Inciſions, Contuſions, Rackings, Searings, Scourgings, Scaldings, or
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:34484:188"/> the like; theſe muſt make grievous Impreſſions on the Nerves, and agitating them by furious Tenſions, or Vellications, muſt tranſmit the Motions to the common <hi>Senſorium,</hi> and ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite moſt dolorous Pains in their Souls. For the Nerves which are thee great Inſtrument of Senſe, derive their Original from the Brain; and by innumerable Sprigs or Ramifications being ſpread and propagated through the Body, they terminate in the exterior parts of it. So that nothing of violence can be done out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly to the Body, but at the ſame time it lights upon the Fibres of ſome of thoſe Nerves, whoſe Extremities are lodged in its <hi>Superficies,</hi> I mean, in the <hi>Cutis</hi> or Skin there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. And if theſe at any time be fiercely moved, tho' at the Ends of them moſt diſtant from the Head; yet the ſame motion, at the ſame time, is felt at their <hi>other</hi> Ends which are in the Brain. And the <hi>Seat</hi> of the Soul, or the proper place of her ſpecial vital Reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, being ſome where there; She cannot but be vehemently affected thereby. But then we muſt conſider, that theſe Nerves may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive Impreſſions as well at the Roots of them within the Brain; as in any parts of any Branches of them any where diſperſed in the Body. Yea there is reaſon why they ſhould be moſt receptive of impreſſions there, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing nearer to the common <hi>Sentient,</hi> and ſo to the Soul her ſelf.</p>
               <p>Now let us but ſuppoſe (and the Suppoſition is very eaſy) that the Bleſſed SPIRIT can ſo influence the Soul, and ſo poſſeſs her with ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſhing Delights (which we call <hi>Comforts</hi>) as wholly to take her up, and divert her from at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:34484:189"/> to what the Body ſuffers: and this muſt be one mighty Alleviation of pain, if not a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Excluſion or Cure of it. For what better <hi>Anodyne</hi> can there be, than an abſolute inani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madverſion, or non-reflection upon Evil? than a compleat alienation, or entire abſtraction of the Mind from what ſhould trouble it? And then let us but ſuppoſe alſo (as well we may) that the ſame good SPIRIT can imprint ſuch delicate Motions upon the curious Fibres of all the Nerves in the Brain, as ſhall produce ſtrong divine Joys and Pleaſures; and that theſe fine Motions may be ſo brisk and vigorous, as to continue in ſpite of all contrary Impreſſions, tho' never ſo forcible, made by any Violence on other parts of the Filaments of thoſe Nerves: and the great Work we ſpeak of is intelligibly done upon the holy Sufferers. For thus we may readily and fairly apprehend, how all ſenſe of Pain ſhould be drowned in them; and how their Souls might ſwim in deep Conſolations, when their Bodies were ſinking under the Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutioner's hands. Not that we ſuppoſe tho, that the SPIRIT's influence upon Martyrs was ever ſo ſtrong and vigorous, as to leave no room or occaſion for their Faith, Love, Patience, and the like divine Graces to act in, for their bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Support and Comfort.</p>

               </p>
               <p>Firſt, Becauſe the evil Spirit with whom they are in Covenant, <hi>may be delighted with the Steams of humane Blood.</hi> (And for a like reaſon they haunt Church-yards more than other Places, and appear moſt frequently where the Dead are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terred.) So <hi>Origen</hi> tells <hi>Celſus</hi> pretty often, how the <hi>Daemons</hi> were gratifi'd with the Steams of thoſe bloody Sacrifices which were offered to them, and how they were greedily deſirous of them. Which he calls, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>: <hi>the lickoriſhneſs of Carnal Devils.</hi> And that they are ſtrangely deſirous of the Blood of Mankind, and delighted with it; is evident from the Complaints which the Devil us'd to make amongſt his Devotoes in <hi>America.</hi> For often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times when he appeared to them, he would tell them he was <hi>thirſty;</hi> meaning for Peoples Blood. And then his Prieſts would urge their Kings to offer up ſtore of Captives to their Gods, leſt (poor things) they ſhould die for want of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhment. And as when they had no Captives, they would go out on purpoſe to fight and take ſome; ſo when they had plenty, they would offer them moſt freely, killing them as Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctims, ſometimes by hundreds in a Day. To which we may add thoſe <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, or Mactations of Men, wherein Multitudes of old were ſadly ſacrific'd to heathen Deities. And
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:34484:190"/> if the reekings of dead or dying Sacrifices, were ſo grateful to them; without all queſtion, the Nidours, or Fumes exhaled from the Veins of People alive, muſt be far more pleaſing. For being of an hotter and finer nature, they may well yield them a brisker and more reliſhing Flavour.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Evil Spirits <hi>ſuck</hi> of thoſe Wretches, whom they draw into helliſh Compacts with them; that they <hi>may have opportunity of corrupting them, by transfuſing a pernicious Venom into them.</hi> Of tincturing their Bodies with ſo vile a Malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, as will help to numm and ſtupify their Souls, in their moral Capacity. As ſhall fill them with Darkneſs, and Blindneſs, and Dul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and Deadneſs to all that is good; and at the ſame time diſpoſe them to every evil thing, to which they ſhall think fit to excite and inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate them. As to Anger, Envy, Malice, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge, the baſeſt Obſcenities, and moſt barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Cruelties. And when wicked Fiends by their noxious Breathings into People, do ſo poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon their Souls as to pervert their Bodies; no wonder that the HOLY GHOST (who ſtill countermines the Wicked One in all his Workings) ſhould by His Inſpirations (I mean His <hi>conſolatory</hi> ones) not only moſt heavenly affect our Souls; but withal derive an <hi>healthful Temper</hi> to our Bodies.</p>

For as the Bodies of Men in high Diſtempers, are ſo full of morbific Virulence or Malignity in themſelves; as to breathe out ſuch ſtore of contagious Emiſſions, as will infect others with the like Diſeaſes: ſo they that are arrived at this excellent Temper, and delicate Complexion of Body, which ſends forth theſe ſalutiferous and medicinal Exhalati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; may ſecretly and unperceivably derive Health, as well as preſerve it to thoſe Perſons, with whom they frequently or conſtantly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe.</p>
